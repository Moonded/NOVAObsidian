Intergalactic standard date: November 11th, 2950

After a couple of months nose to the grindstone, I've finally done it. I've saved up enough to buy the [[Constellation Phoenix]] as well as the 85x. Its been grueling and dangerous, mining quantanium, especially with pirate activity as increased as it has been, but the satisfaction is worth it. I've taken them both out for their maiden voyages, and they were definitely worth every penny. I finally have time to relax and just explore the system, like I've been craving the last few months. Looking forward to all the sightseeing. Will likely start with [[MicroTech]], as I've heard it's absolutely gorgeous there.
