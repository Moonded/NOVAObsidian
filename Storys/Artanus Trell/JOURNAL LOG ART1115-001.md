The grenade bounce was as effective as I had hoped. I found out plenty about Glen’s operation. I had enough dirt on him to turn him over to the authorities, end his business, or both. It would come in quite handy when dealing with him in the future. Unfortunately, he didn’t have anything useful regarding The Orphanage. All he could tell me was that lately, he hadn’t been running anything out that way. Something about the computer system malfunctioning or that they were no longer taking in orders. It sounded weak to me, but it was clear from the terror in Glen’s eyes as the grenade landed in his lap that he wasn’t about to lie to me. So right now, this lead was dry.  

I had two messages waiting for me from Bill “aka [[Scardfaice]]”. The first message was just an acknowledgement of my previous message. I was glad he received it. I was going to need help in this investigation. As I read the second message though, I just sighed. The administrator at [[Bajini]] was like a big fish in a little pond. Egotistical, probably had gotten the job through connections rather than on merit. Not a bad person, but someone I tried to avoid and keep my head down around. You couldn’t always count on him to be reasonable. If Bill had done something to offend him personally, you could bet he was going to do some time in [[Klescher]]. The message itself was lacking in details regarding what exactly had happened, so I had no idea what to expect. I just knew that I couldn’t do this next part without some back up.  

I scrolled through the other communiques on my [[MobiGlass]]. Cepheus7 of the Heathens, a [[NOVA Marine]] squadron, was following up on a lead at [[Klescher]]. Chappie had acknowledged with a brief message that only stated “Chappie inbound”. I had no idea where she was heading or if she could be of any help. I decided to head to [[Bajini Point]] and see if I could get more information on Bill’s predicament, finish any repairs on the Hammer, and stock up on weapons and supplies. I fired up the quantum drive and set the navigation to [[ArcCorp]] - [[Bajini Point]]. I set it on autopilot and engaged the drive.

I left the pilot seat and headed back to the habitation area of the Hammer. I sat down and began pouring over intelligence reports and information I had acquired while running cargo.  

There were restricted areas all over [[Lyria]], some run by [[Blackjac]] personnel. Others were run by various criminal organizations and factions. I had been hired by [[Blackjac]] as a freelancing merc to take back one of their security bunkers that had been assaulted and overrun with terrorists. I never knew what group it was, but they all had strange looking Armor. It was painted teal and red, with menacing looking helmets where the eye sockets glowed yellow and red. Quite honestly, it made them easier to kill because they looked more like alien intruders than human with that get up. I had collected several pieces of their Armor, along with some heavy weapons. I figured it might come in handy for future infiltration missions to look like them. The missile launcher and rail gun were just added bonuses. I couldn’t leave them behind.  

I pulled up a map of [[Lyria]]. There were caves I had heard of that tourists, adventurers, and thrill seekers had gotten lost in. I have only ventured into a cave system once before. They span kilometres underground and they are unmapped. I never found the person I was sent out to find. The only reason I made it out myself was because I had the good sense to bring flares and mark my way back. If I hadn’t, I would still be there, likely dead. Those cave systems would be the perfect place to hide, or even run operations out of.  

The quantum drive beeped at me. We were approaching [[Bajini Point]] and about to exit quantum travel. I still didn’t know where I was going to start. I pushed myself away and went back to the cockpit to handle the landing myself. There are some things I just don’t trust the computer with yet. Once in the pilot seat, I sent out another transmission, wide-band and encrypted.  

This is [[Artanus]]. I’m tracking down some lost valuables and require assistance. They’ve gone missing from their owners around [[ArcCorp]]. I’m looking to restore them to their rightful owners. I’m currently docked at [[Bajini Point]] for the next couple of days. If you have information to share, let’s meet up to discuss.

  

All I can hope for is that someone will respond and has more information. Otherwise, we’ll have to go hunting on Lyria. Something I’m not entirely opposed to. Now...what to do about Bill…
