------------------------------------BEGIN LOG--------------------------------------

  

For fucks sake, these Area18 trains take forever. I already missed the ones from MicroTech, almost got used to them, but I had been too many years on that damn space station, my whole life to be precise, till recent years.

After turning, 18 I was done with that place, it wasn’t bad, but I needed more and I knew I was capable of it, I remembered looking at the vastness of the all expanding space through the lobby’s glass, jealous from all those who checked on the security wing and retrieve their vessels ready to depart, all the adventures I was missing.

  

My whole family advised otherwise, it was a more secure place to be, and it was true, and endless certainty of your life waited for those who choose to stay there, because yes father, freedom is scary, being on your own through uncertainty is scary, but that's half of it.

  

Being in a pilot seat with the thrusters roaring on your back, ready to launch on your command wherever you please, the universe at the palm of your hand, oh what indescribable feeling, distilled excitement, and passion on their pure form. I learned that after a family friend let me try their ship at an earlier age, and I knew it by then, yet I couldn't get them to understand me. But that was their life, and it’s their business, not mine.

  

2 years went by and since, after starting with some low cargo jobs found at the station bar, I managed to get myself a cozy little apartment at New Babbage, with my own ship now and a hangar when needed. Oh boy were those the best years of my life so far, met friends and women from all over the system, flying through clouds and nature’s most beautiful creations, planets with landscapes you couldn’t even dream of.

Had some hard action too, found out the adrenaline of chasing a fighter through asteroids or the sound of the empty rounds falling as I pulled the trigger. Found on me a passion and commitment like for nothing else I ever had, always on the lookout for people to teach me new tricks and ideas to improve my skills to outmaneuver enemies on the battlefield.

  

But I quickly found out this was not the place.

I wondered if one could get professional and organized combat training for a living, not simple bounties or errands where things could get messy from time to time, but real support to a greater cause and do proper good.

  

Eventually, I found out you could, yet that was no epiphany, I learned it the tough way. I had seen many hardships and pain through this lifestyle too, but all changed after Anne.

  

The outpost was a family business, simple cargo job, grab the boxes and get back. The scavengers had cut off the power by the time I came, they were taking everything they could find. I had seen the warning & bounty from the UEE, but didn’t mind it until I landed.

A non-registered piece of junk with thrusters was lifting off and getting ready to jump. System: Power diverted to low thrusters; weapons ready.

  

Wirrrrrrrrr… Clickrrrrrr… The Mantis GT-220 spun at 600 rounds per minute, as they hitted the thrusters of the scavenger’s ship that was skipping town. The thing was so cheap made that it couldn’t last more than 15 seconds before the main thruster tore apart from the ship and exploded as it was falling to the ground, with the flying junk following.

  

It seemed like some kind of soldiers had already secured the outpost and family when I arrived, but 2 of them managed to escape to their ship and try flee with the cargo, which were now insulting me in a rare dialect. They were taken in to be transported to Klescher by the UEE Feds who had just arrived, mf don’t even know what they are about to get in there.

Sadly, these pieces of shit had used tear gas bombs to breach in the outpost, and the small daughter, Anne, lied unconscious with respiratory issues now. The medic from the team said she would be alright but would need some time, the family was hurt in all ways imaginable as they circled the bed where Anne was, I felt my heart breaking for a moment.

  

The squad leader came to me as he took his helmet off, they were part of the NOVA Organization – Relief division, and told me that a man with the balls to take down a ship like that could do well in their Defence división. If I was interested, there might be a spot for me on a squad commanded by a guy named Dowg (yeah with a w the fuck) in ArcCorp, where NOVA HQ was based. I appreciated the proposal and said I would think about it as I went back to check on the family and grab the damn boxes I was there for.

  

Almost freaked the fuck out cause I didn’t know there were creepy crawlers on this side of Lyria, turns out there weren’t.

  

- “Thank you so much sir, my dads were so scared of those meanies.” A little girl in a small spacesuit was holding my hand and a toy on the other. Spoked with the sweetest voice I ever herd, there is just no evil at that age. She was still coughing a little.

  

- “Oh it was nothing kido, I’m so glad you are good now, and don’t you worry ok? We will always be here to take care of you and your family”

  

- “You promise? Here take him with you and bring him back to visit when we need you again”

  

- Oh sweetie no thank you I could nev…” But the tiny toy was already in my hands as she made me grab it with all her little strength. She said his name was Annie and insisted that I should carry it with me, with those innocent and desperate eyes looking at you, you just can’t say no.

  I said goodbye to Anne and her family, promised to take care of Annie and come back to visit them. A changed man walked into the ship. I had already taken my decision, Stanton was hurting, and it was time to stop playing around and do something about it.

  -System: Quantum travel initiated, arriving at ArcCorp in T-13 minutes.

  

Shit, and to think I made this whole log while on this dirty flying bread, damn this thing takes its time. –System: Arriving to ArcCorp plaza.

I’m supposed to meet this guy called Dowg near the bar to talk about their proposal at NOVA, they said to look for a pin with lemons on his chest, who the hell even wears that.

  

Ah, ArcCorp, so beautifully frightening. Elegant black building high as I’ve ever seen, full of colorful art for the eyes, and smog for the lungs, with crime beneath for those who don’t make it that far. To be delighted by the photos you can take here, and to be killed by while doing so by an ex Klescher inmate.

A world consumed by corporations in the most literal way. Through time I’ve learned some things never change, progress is expensive, and there is no rest for the damned. This reminds me of how lucky I am after everything.

  

Yet… this time was different; I could feel it. Ever had that feeling that some bad shit is about to go down? My gut has never failed me.

  

6 minutes 30 seconds left, ahh and that smell, oh yes burritos, suddenly I realized I hadn’t eaten in god knows how many hours. I approached the bar to ask for a burrito and Fizz, there weres two men talking on a table, damn it, no lemon pin.

They seemed... familiar…pulled the M.O.T.H out of my chest pocket and put it on my right ear, I wanted to take look.

Static noise – Unintelingible –“God damn it Kar, why shouldn’t we take it? For that pay, I don’t give a shit about the cargo, that money could do some real good for us.”

  

-“Quiet, you don’t get what we are dealing with here Mat, this goes beyond skipping some patrols and taking some shots with the UEE.”

  

Smugglers, I remembered them from a job or two from quite some time ago, not the funny ones.

  

-“You sound like a pussy to me, after all we have been through Kar, really? you are gonna say no to this? Hold on… this about that shit I heard you talking on Grim Hex huh? That thing about some Orphanageaghhh” ~Mat’s faced chuckled as Kar immediately took it by the sides, almost crushed it

  

He gave a muffled shout to Mat – “DO YOU WANNA GET US KILLED KID? Out of your goddamn mind, sit and finish what you eating, repairs must be almost ready at the hangar.”

  

An Orphanage? What in the freaking world are they...TaiiNnNnnNNiNNiNN…

...The high-pitched ping of the voice through the M.O.T.H almost left me deaf on my right ear. I had folded a little my head as I was taking it out... I realized I was being shouted at

  

- “HEY YOU? God damn it… were you listening to us you stupid kid? Huh? Got any business with me?”

  

- “Hey take it easy fucker! I was just eating and hearing some music, but I don’t mind the trouble old fuck” ... I placed my hand over the Coda on my holster as I finished that sentence.

  Some guards came rushing immediately and the smugglers walked away the second they saw them; guess we won't have action today.

  I was on my way to turn my back and finishing eating, when I saw a yellow dot shining in the corner of the lobby, he had been watching the whole show and was smiling, as he started walking towards me. Subtly shinning from his shoulder, I noticed, a silver “N” with a ring across.
