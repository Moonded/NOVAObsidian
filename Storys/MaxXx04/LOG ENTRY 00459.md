CALLSIGN: MaxXx04
LOCATION: STANTON; OUTER RIM; CLASSIFIED
SHIP: RSI POLARIS | NSS LODESTAR

  

Fuck me…yet again Max, yet again. My dorm was all dark, just a faint light from beneath the door coming from the ship corridor’s light. Again, I had awakened almost 2 hours before my alarm was set. The darkness of space really changes your sleep, and people used to complain about Jetlag.

  

I was of course used to it, but after spending my time in Calliope that changed for a little. My request for some vacations was accepted by the boss 2 weeks ago, he was happy with my performance as a Leviathan, we were all performing well, as the squad begin to grow over the last months.

If I had ever told anyone all the adventures I would’ve lived, the ships and battles I would be on, no one would’ve believed me. Yet, it was damn true, and it was just as a dream of.

  

I was welcomed aboard the NSS Lodestar on my first day, the Polaris was the squadron flagship, and I almost felt over my ass the first time I saw it. It was a beautiful steel-built machine made of pure terror and advanced engineering. When you see a ship like this, you realize that in combat you don’t need héroes, you need monsters.

Training would be held throughout the week as we scouted and patrol the outer rims of the system, our primary role as part of NOVA Defence, if not aiding our Frontiers división or participating in any other important combat operations, and boy did we get into some big trouble.

Bunker breaches, close combat operations, and major space battles were our bread and butter. In combat, you stop feeling your body as you become one with the machine. Hearing where was our next target would be blown up to hell was something I had never experienced before, and paradoxically, nothing of all that's going on bothers you, including the fact that you could be someone else's target. Solely focused and controlled, at peace in the midst of chaos.

  

Yet the best bit was once it was over, and we would all hang out in a bar to let our adrenaline flow away between drinks and endless laughs over the table. Eating, drinking, and hearing stories of past glories and adventures of the most experienced members, realising you are in the right spot and if comrade’s love was even a thing this was it because these were the best and most disciplined guys I had ever known, and now I cared about them too.

The conversation would generally develop on some tragedies lived through our lives as the time went by, for those who hadn’t already gone to bed of course, but that will be kept for the Leviathans.

  

Though I must say those fuckers can also get on your nerves, they couldn’t help laughing when they saw me come out of the ship with my whole body shaking after my first 3 hours of turret training, but on all fairness, I would’ve laughed at myself too.

I needed to sort out some important business with my family, who were still on the station, as always, life is a constant of endless expanding routine for them.

I finished my stuff there, had some time with them too, they were happy about my new career at NOVA, but they were simply being polite, they had no clue of anything I was explaining neither were able to imagine it, actually, I'm certain they can’t imagine anything asides that station. After then, I had some true time off, at Calliope.

  

They offered a cozy unit to stay with them, the family was happy to see me and Anne went crazy when I walked out the ship, and even more when I showed Annie, her toy, was in great shape (luckily, cause I don’t even know how to sew a button). I took them for a small trip too, they had never been able to explore and see beautiful and peaceful their moon was, and that's what I enjoyed from that place, peace. Good place for thinking, plus they make some great breakfast and food, everything is grown by them.

  

Nothing compares to having that breakfast at top of the morning while you see the snowfall outside. But like everything that's good… I had to go back, duty called, and this time it sounded strange. I could tell the chief was weird when called at the end of the week to check on me, didn’t say a word but I felt it, on Thursday at 0700 I had to be back on the NSS Lodestar, and so I did.

Dowg welcomed me back himself at the hangar, but there was something odd, strange about him, on his face, I didn’t like it. As we walked in he told me the boys had gone out with Lieutenant Red Erc on a new training operation, which was a fancy way of saying another field trip full of jokes and shooting with the Joker Squadron, commanded by Fly Molo. They are great fun and even greater pilots, they also aided us in combat, saved our asses a couple times. Those bastards must be already having a great time, perfect timing Max, as always.

  

And now it's freaking 4:17 in the morning, and instead of being with the Jokers I’m getting changed because my body can't get back to fucking sleep, and where the hell did I leave my chest armor?

  

After getting everything on and getting my Arclight and medgun on my holsters I went out. The chances of coming across Dowg at this hour are rare, but certain that if he saw me without them he would go crazy, mandatory issue for all the crew, “-they are small, effective and reliable” he would go “-no reason why you should ever be without them”. God, I can even hear his voice in my head.

  

I went back to my room to take a shower and have some breakfast later, I prefer training without feeling full.

The room was still a bit steamy and I was starving, wishing there were some leftover burritos on the fridge when my comms notification came up, it read:

  

Nice training lad, hope you haven’t gained a few and just catching up with the routine. On a different note, we need to talk, ASAP, come to my quarters. And bring some coffee on your way.

  

This time is too early for a meeting, even for him, saying bad news are coming must be an understatement. And damn it, u can’t even fart in this ship without Dowg knowing it, sometimes I feel the Lodestar is just an extension of his freaking body.

The doors closed behind me as I came into the captain’s quarters. He didn’t look at me, he was lost staring again at that picture on the sidewall, last time that happened things didn’t end well. He did feel the smell of the steaming cups on my hands.

  

- “Ah yeah, I needed one of those today”

- “You definitely look like it, got you covered, black, no sugar.” I said, as I seated in front of him and placed both cups on the table. Lots of reports were on his display, black-labeled...classified.

- “…Perfect”A subtle smile came up as he started drinking. “So, how was the family bud, and that kid you went visit on Calliope?”

- “Well the business went smooth on the station, they were uncharming as always. But I did get some good rest on that moon, its really peaceful you know? Maybe you should come with me some time”

- “Yeah… maybe I should.” he said as he took the cup for another round of coffee.

  

Not that he was not interested in me, but I knew he was just dissimulating his stress with the small talk, he was too polite to say it.

“So sir” I lean towards him as I placed both arms on the table.

  

- “Yeah I know, it’s all over my face, lets cut it shall we?”

  I nodded with approval.

  

* -“Right then. Some major shit has just gone down on Area 18, an operation failed, shots fired and a rookie Defence soldier was kidnapped. But what happened is almost unimportant, the important question is why did this all happen in the first fucking place”

  

- “That much I can tell, we wouldn't be here for an incident on Area 18 with us being in the outer freaking rim. So what’s the catch boss, what was this operation about?”

- “I know you have already seen the labels on the reports in front me, and what they mean. The information and the intel you will be handed after this meeting is Tier Six, comes from up top. I’m confident that as a Leviathan I don’t need to tell you how you must handle this” I was about to when he spoke again “And yes, there is a Tier Six, you just didn’t know about it because you shouldn't”

- “Gotcha, and now I do because you want only your best man on it don’t you?” I joked with a smile on my face, he was used to it, I was very stoked at that point, I won’t deny it

- “Well now… wouldn’t you like to know you bastard. Nor will I answer that question as I don’t need to remind you that you are Leviathan, and you all are the best of the best in the whole Navy. Plus, you being here answers solely to the fact the rest of the squad is on training and I need a man of my own on this. That’s it”

  

- “Yeah yeah, keep telling that to yourself until you believe it” There, I made him smile.“Now brief me up chief”

  

- “Oh I won’t do that, not this time. You will gear your ass up and get on your ship, Wing Commander BandaderArten will contact you on your way back to the system. He is commanding this whole operation, one of his men if coming back with new Intel. Reach the location and pay close attention to the briefing”

  MaxXx04 — 03/05/2022 9:48 PM

  “Roger that then, I will report back to you later on how this develops as always, anything else I need to know?”

  

- “Yes actually. This whole shit is very dark, things will get nasty soldier. Given your past, I’m hoping this won’t be an issue. Also, you will get into very sketchy places, all of your identities could be compromised, even as NOVA members we may not be able to guarantee your protection. Therefore, I'm also hoping you won't mind using your old codename back when I found you…Rex.” I felt the chill through my spine as he said that name, it has been a god damn while for sure, I’m starting to lose my sense of humour about this.

  The ramp started closing as I placed the last ammo box in the Titan, I had enough rounds and armor for a whole battalion, better be safe than sorry.

  

_Landing gear retracted_ the ship was already hovering on the hangar, as I waited for the doors to open after hauling Dowg.

  

- Good luck out there Max, stay safe

  

- Thanks boss, don’t you worry, I’ll get this done. I’ll be cooking burritos in the kitchen before you know it.

  

- Yeah crap that can certainly wait, I can already smell those things.

  

- Say what you want to say, I know you love them. On your signal cap.

  

- Very well, you are cleared for takeoff. And remember Leviathan… We behold.

  

- Sir yes sir.
