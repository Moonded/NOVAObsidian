- Had some fun down there huh?

- Oh you don’t have the slightest, combat was very intense, had some losses.

  -Yet I heard it was a success overall right? Not much info coming, this op is kept all dark, hope u had something more for me.

  -Something else is a fucking understatement ha, I was about to build my report matter of fact, let me get my head straight and I’ll call you. Say 1500?

- That’s alright with me, btw how is Rineo? I forgot to tell you he was gonna be there too.

  -Yeah u did, he is alright, he was not with me but made quite the example as I was told.

  -Nice, go get that report done then, see you in a while. I have some news of my own too, will let you know later

  -Roger.

  

Now now, not even him is fully aware of what went down, but to be fair, I’m not that sure either. That damn tank shell left my head spinning around, it’s all coming down now with the adrenaline getting diluted in my body. Maybe Rineo should check me later, put those medic skills to good use.

For the moment, let’s get the facts straight into this log and take care of the rest later. It's a good routine after combat, let’s settle everything. That and cleaning your gear, it’s almost like therapy.

How curious, I’ve heard of this Admiral before, never thought I would be making a debrief for him, I need to place this tag before the start. Apparently, we all do.

OFFICIAL ORPHANAGE ASSAULT OPERATION DEBRIEF.

INTENDED FOR DOLBI, NOVA ADMIRAL.

CLASSIFIED - TIER 6

  

Wing commander Bandadarten gave us a briefing on the operation once we all gathered on Area18. ArchangelCorps was already in position, scouting the outpost, along with marksman Perdroblunttoker. The Intel provided by them reported a rather small outpost surrounded by mountains, armed personnel was on site along with a Carrack and the Freelancer where the Rookie was captured and taken prisoner. They could also confirm children were unloaded and placed inside the compound.

  

Our strategy was the following: We would be deployed on ground about 6 clicks away, split into 3 armed cyclones, one driver and one gunner each. Attacking from west and East plus giving support to the scouts on top of the mountain.

  

We loaded our gear and headed to Lyria, and while en route, we received new Intel. A tank that appeared to be partially functional was on-site defending the outpost. Seems like it was far too easy without it.

  

TL Cepheus would be my gunner. We headed West around the hillside of the mountain, coming from the left side of the Carrick where the tank had been reported shooting already along the hostile infantry.

  

Comms were a bit noisy as I drove, but Cepheus informed me our marksmen were downed but alive, and were being assisted by one of the other units.

  

As we approached on the left the tank spotted and started shooting our vehicle. Despite evasive maneuvers being attempted, we were almost out in the open and sooner or later we would get hit, and we finally did. The left-back tire got hit after a missile exploded right behind us, yet both the TL and I didn’t suffer any damage.

  

Since the tank was too far and getting entertained by the other units as they approached from east and downhill, we got out and found cover about 200m in front of the cyclone.

  

While hiding I spotted 2 hostile elements rushing up to the carrick trying to ambush Bandander’s unit from behind. After the all-clear from Cepheus I attempted to take one of them while running as the other got into cover, unfortunately, I only got a few impacts and was out of effective range. We were able to pinpoint the hostile's location based on our markers to the marksman who shot them down.

  

At the same time, the tank seemed to be free of hostilities and attempted to go and look for us on our cyclone, or was escaping our fire,on any way, they left west passing through the hillside and we capitalized on it since it was our only obstacle.

  

We rushed uphill and secured the outside of the outpost while Bandader’s unit went in. Both the kids and the rookie were inside, a fast breach led by Bandadartenw was all it took to take the hostiles inside.

  

After securing our VIPs, our snipers warned hostiles were coming from the west, a sniper plus an infantry soldier. We called for immediate evac as we went out and cleared our surroundings.

  

The hostiles were coming all from the hillside, rushing west of the Orphanage location. We used the Freelancer as cover and held our position shooting at will, the snipers were key both on eliminating and suppressing the targets, holding their move over us.

  

In the end, the sniper got killed by our marksmen and other was dispatched by a marine. NOVA suffered two losses, brave soldiers, plus we had some injured, including TL Cepheus who was boarded quickly into a Pisces snub as we left the compound. All the kids on site were rescued along with our NOVA element.

  

Plus the unit led by Archangelcorps stayed a bit longer and managed to recover critical Intel, containing files, which appear to reveal more locations like this scattered throughout the system.

  

The preliminary theory is that we are facing a wide complex organization with multiple cells on Stanton at least, with the kids and their use being just a part of their entire operation, whose objective remains unknown. Yet we will have to wait for further analysis from our HQ at ArcCorp.
