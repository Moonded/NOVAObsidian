Upon awaking the next morning without any issues, all officers met in the bridge. We assessed the situation and processed the information and basically all came to the conclusion that this was far too close of a call.  

However we all came to the same consensus that we were also in to deep to back out now. Shots were fired on all sides and unfortunately we fired upon the [[Ninetails]] one of the most ruthless criminal groups in the system.  

If we step away from "[[twitch]]" we leave our self vulnerable where we haven't made contact in truce to [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] the people who helped us fix our ship a bit ago. Until we are able to make contact if we left "[[twitch]]" we would be by ourselves most likely being hunted and probably make an enemy of "[[twitch]]". Plus she does pay very very well. Big risk big reward.  

During our meeting as we were finishing up i get a ping on my [[MobiGlass]] from "twitch" and it reads as:  

Coordinates soon, had some trouble last night, stay low, be safe  

Sounds like they had some trouble last night as well. I figured while we were waiting for the meeting point there was an emergency center near by and we could do a run of med supplies to another contact that inquired a bit ago.
  
We all agree to load up head out and make a pick up at the location.
