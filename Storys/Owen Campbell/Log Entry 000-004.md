Upon arrival at the emergency shelter while waiting for the supplies on microtech to be loaded we realized we were low on fuel and supplies for the crew.  

[[Rosco]]: "sir we may make it to port tressler if we are lucky."  

Me: "[[Rosco]] do you have any idea what i am going to say to you?"  

[[Rosco]]: "Why didn't I tell you earlier? Sir."  

Me: " you have flown with me for a very very long time Rosco. If you call me "Sir" one more time I will personally order you to clean the entire ship with a rag, outside, in the snowy mountains of [[MicroTech]]… In your boxers … Understood?"  

[[Rosco]]: "yes captain"  

Me: "can we make it to port [[Tressler]]?"  

[[Rosco]]: "by my calculations yes."  

Me: "that doesn't give me much confidence" jokingly  

We finishing loading up then take off from [[MicroTech]] and make a b line for port [[Tressler]]. We float into port on the last sput of the engines and dock up and stop for some grub and refueling. As we were sitting at the bar and the crew at a couple tables. As [[rosco]] and i were sitting at the bar a male and female walk in sporting a symbol we have seen before. The [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] symbol.  

Me recognizing one of them: "are you the one who helped the stranded carrack a bit ago?"
