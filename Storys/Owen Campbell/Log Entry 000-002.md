We got to the next meet up point this time without any issues we met this shady lady went by the name "[[twitch]]" with some sort of metal device on her hand near [[Area 18]].  

[[Twitch]]: "I heard you can move things across the system quickly and quietly."  

Me: "if all goes to plan"  

[[Twitch]]: hands me a piece of paper

"Having a hard time getting some large quantities of weapons i need. Nothing too special except the missiles. My last contact came to an end unfortunately is seems the nine tails bought him out."  

Her order was as follows:  

15 S5 Reaper V and various other S2 and 3
100scu worth of p4 AR with a mix of S71's
25 Railguns
15 grenade launchers
15 Shoulder mounted rocket launchers
120 P6-LR

And what ever I can fit with ammo and basic medical supplies  

I feel like this may be a lot for the size of what her operation seemed like. She didn't bring many people to protect her during the meet so either she's not scared of us or she doesn't have that many people. But who knows. She did look good though not gonna lie. She handled herself with a lot of authority and experience as well.  

[[Twitch]]: "ill give you the details of the meeting location in a few hours, we want to secure a location."  

Me: "Ill see what I can do on this it shouldn't be a problem, I might be a few short on the [[Reaper V]] but should be able to get the few extra I need."  

[[Twitch]]: "Ill supply an escort if needed."  

Me: "I got a couple escort meeting me half way we should be all set."  

[[Twitch]]: turns toward her pilot

"Make sure they get out of atmosphere please"  

Gave a nod and stuck the not in the covering over my left shoulder that has a pocket on the inside. We headed out with little extra talk.  

As we broke out of atmo her pilots came up beside the bridge gave a wave and peeled off. I took a couple extra jumps to the rendezvous point just in case.

Turned to my co pilot Rosco and mentioned the fact that that i was worried we werent gonna be leaving the planet. He didnt seem worried at all. 

We headed to our stash and loaded up and even emptied out one of the gun stashes. Once loaded we headed back to the set meet point in the middle of nowhere on [[ArcCorp]]. Out in the open which i didn't like.  

Met with "[[Twitch]]" she approached with a couple [[Freelancers]] and a gladiator to carry a majority of the missiles and 3 arrow fighters. Multiple people got out to help from the freighters but the arrow pilots stayed near their ships with the engines running. As the weapons were being moved between the carrack and the other ships. We stood to the side with "[[twitch]]" as she barked orders of where her men needed to put stuff. This aura of anger came off her as we were in the middle of the exchange and I felt as if I was fuelling something I shouldn't.  

In between her telling her me people what to do we had a half way decent conversation this time. All though she kept asking us a lot of questions where she was probably trying to get a feel for us.  

[[Twitch]]: "What go you into gun running?"  

Me: "I got into shipping when I needed money and the only thing I had access to at the time was a [[cutlass black]]. Someone needed medical supplies shipped between [[MicroTech]] and [[Crusader]]. Then moved my way up to the carrack and not i ship anything for money."  

[[Twitch]]: " you ship anything?"  

Me: " anything from medical to food, from weapons to ores and gems, other commodities to people."  

[[Twitch]]: "Ill have to keep that in mind"  

...  

"I will have a lot to be moved very soon I may need your help with"  

"But there is a catch"  

Me:" and whats that?"  

[[Twitch]]:"if i catch you dealing with wallace kim, michael shaw, or eddie par ill have your head"  

Me: "well noted"

All of a sudden her mobiglass starts blinking and someone calls her  

Unknown voice: " the meeting point has been compromised and you need to get out of there. Fighters imbound!"  

She all of a sudden yelled at us:  

[[Twitch]]: "Take off and we'll meet up later to finish ill transfer the money now!"  

Me and my co [[pilot]] [[Rosco]] sprint toward the carrack as a vanguard launched two missiles with a volley of fire from its nose gun in the midst of chaos killing one of my guys and 3 of hers retreating. Flowed by two volleys from a gladius missing everyone.  

I see her fighters immediately take off and I called my fill in pilot "Treble" to take off and assist on my [[MobiGlass]]. The [[arrows]] much faster but lacking the heavy gunfire of the vanguard and gladius will have to rely on their speed to take them on. My top mounted turret starts to open fire on the enemy fighter making another approach. At this point i can make out a gladius is starting to make an approach, the shields barely surviving the turret fire lets open fire on the ground for only a half second before a missile out of no where strikes the gladius bursting it into a fireball in the sky. I followed the smoke to a near by mountain to the north from what i can only think of with a missile that big from the ground a basilisk hiding away in the mountain. At that point just getting to the base of the ramp i see one of "[[twitch]]'s fighters get blown out of the sky by another gladius from its gatling gun. But this time i got a good sight of the paint job and one anyone in the system would recognize.

The blue and pinkish red orange accents with the pink Asian symbol on the wing.  

The [[Ninetails]]  

We reach the bridge at this point all turrets are firing non stop trying to take down the last two known fighters. We power the engines on and start to get momentum at this point [[twitch]]'s ships are off the ground too in formation with us. At this point my crew in the chaos trying to fight off the enemy fighters as we get about 100 meters off the ground the second gladius is making its run on us our shield holding up well while another missile from the north connects with the gladius striking it down.  

The only known thing left attacking us was a vanguard which was no where to be seen. As we reach the altitude to break atmosphere the arrow piloted by "treble" returns to the hanger claiming he struck the vanguard but couldn't confirm the kill and claims it flew off injured"  

After the fighter lands we split off from twitch's formation and head to a hide out near [[Hurston]].  

After landing we all sigh in relief after a second close call in a short period of time. Upon landing I check my [[MobiGlass]] and she held her word 1.5 million credits. A message that reads "we'll talk soon". She only left 4 crates of p4 rifles and a few [[S2 missiles]] so not much left curious why she would even risk the rest of it.  

We power down all systems but shields and turrets and people will take shifts just in case. As the rest of the crew repairs gets bandaged up and rests for the night
