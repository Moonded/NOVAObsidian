Decided to write these logs because I thought I was done for. I got stranded in my cargo ship running from pirates quantum jumping probably too quick for the dative to handle. Only got 10% hydrogen fuel left and the fighter in the bay got shot up before the fight the [[pilot]] [[Johnny]] is still in medical unit struggling to stay alive after taking that hit in his Arrow how he landed with one of the wings barley hanging on is beyond me. We are currently adrift out here in space with a major haul. I don't know how the pirates knew that we were carrying this much on board. Idk how long we will be out here the radio is kinda working.  

The only thing i can think of is we might be halfway between [[CRU L5]] and [[MicroTech]]... Wait... We got a medium freight and heavy fighter inbound ...  

Unknown Voice: " Calling Carrack do you read?"  

Unknown: " This is [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] rescue team and we received a jumbled radio message saying you were attacked and stranded"  

Me: " Oh man am I glad to hear that I've heard of [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] here and there, the landing bay is her blocked with a damaged fighter."  

"We can open the ramp and you could come in that way we could use some help with repairs"  

[[Nova Intergalactic|Nova]] team: "let us pull around to the front and prepare to board"  

Once the cargo was secure we opened the bay and they came in and helped out with repairs and got the drive back up and going we stripped parts off the arrow and found some in the cargo we were hauling. They invited us to reach out to them incase of any hauling needed. Thankfully they didnt look to much in the cargo and realize we were hauling munitions and weapons accross the galaxy i know some people frown on that.  

Once they left we got to our destination and offloaded the goods and the buyer didnt notice the missing parts luckily made a good payday today and scary one.
