BEGIN ENCRYPTED DATA:

The sleek diamond shaped blue and black ship sliced through the frigid Microtech atmosphere at only a couple hundred meters of altitude, just above a shining blue and white lake. 

A silent figure, wearing the latest prototype Avionic Integrated Flight Suit, or AIFS, looked over his left shoulder as he banked the nimble stealth fighter, stealing a glimpse at his recent victory.

In the distance, a blue and gold Anvil Arrow, missing a wing, spiraled helplessly into the shallow water below. The pilot ejecting, upside down, straight into the sand covered bank covered by a thin layer of crystal clear water.

July knew his victory would stir up the NOVA higher ups. Never before have the Syndicate attacked NOVA in open air, unprovoked. All according to his plan.
July reflected on his prior encounter a few months ago, when he coordinated the attack and attempted capture of a NOVA 400i, known as the Point Of No Return. That vessel put up a surprising fight, and even took out a couple of operatives *after* its nose had been blown off and the power completely cut off. 

“We got what we wanted from that. We will get what we want from this as well.” July thought to himself.
He held the center control stick with two fingers, pulling it backwards, the nose of the Aegis Sabre Raven lifting slowly. A gentle 2G’s sinking him into his seat.

Accelerating upwards at increasing speed, the stealth fighter punched through the upper layers of Microtech’s atmosphere. Burning past 1km/s, the wisps of wind against the canopy quieted, and July flipped a series of switches to warm up the quantum drive.

Performing a quick scan of the sensor arrays before engaging the egregious emissions of a spooling QT Drive, July assured the area was clear and selected his destination in space. 
A remote outpost, hidden in one of the millions of asteroids in the Aaron Halo, would be his next stop. 

A couple more switches and a final button press later, a gentle lurch pulled July’s spine into the back of the seat, and the familiar blue glow of the Cherenkov radiation that always accompanied Quantum Travel filled his helmet’s digital visor.

A few thought filled minutes later, the ship lurched once again, exiting Quantum Travel in an nondescript part of the Aaron Halo. Massive Size 7 turrets, both manned and unmanned dotted the astral landscape. Knowing their radar’s wouldn’t pick him up, July elected to transmit on the local radio frequency, rather than wait until a rookie turret gunner decided to take a shot at the unidentified blue spec in the distance. 

“Athalon Base, KSV Finis Temporis.” He radioed. Not more than five seconds later he heard over his helmet speaker, “KSV Finis Temporis, Athalon Base, welcome back. Hope the hunting went well. You are cleared for approach and landing on Pad 6A4. The doors should be open before you arrive.” “Thanks. See you soon. Finis Temporis out.” He pulled the ship’s sleek nose over towards the largest asteroid in the nearby cluster, a couple of flashing red lights now illuminated to guide his approach.

Following the lights carefully, the Raven gracefully weaved through the asteroid field as it made its way home. Rounding the far side of the largest asteroid, a small hangar among a large grid, opened its doors revealing a cold blue lit interior.

Slowing his speed as he drew closer, July flipped the landing gear switch, the distinct hydroelectric *whirrrrr* filling his senses as the three landing legs extended away from the fuselage. 

The blue maneuvering thrusters beneath him now holding him aloft inside the hangar’s atmosphere and artificial gravity, July gently lowered the ship to the hangar floor as he had hundreds of times before.

A soft *clunk* was heard and felt throughout the hangar as the ship made contact. A high pitched whine trailed off, being emitted from the Raven’s spooling down engines. 

July finished his shutdown procedure, bringing all systems offline one by one. He then finished by deactivating the ship’s low emissions hybrid power plant and then popped the front hinged canopy open, the entry/exit ladder automatically deploying. 

July climbed out of the seat, legs stiff from the extended flight. As he descended the short ladder, a female figure clad in armor, a full face helmet obscuring her face, approached. 

“Glad to see you brought my ship back without damage…… Or….?” She said, craning her head back slightly to focus on a scuffed section of the Raven’s left wing.
“Superficial. The NOVA pilot landed some hits, but the shields absorbed all meaningful kinetic energy.” July reported. 
“Hmm. Fine. I'll have Granderly take a look at it tonight. You know any and *all* damage compromises your stealth.” The armor-clad female scolded. 
“Yes, April, I do. Where’s March?” July asked. 
“In his office. He will be awaiting your report.” 
Without a further word, July nodded and proceeded towards the hangar elevator, the ship’s canopy closing autonomously as he walked away. 

A few harshly blue lit corridors and elevators, later, July arrived at an opulent, albeit minimalistic office. The white and gold doors contrast the steel walls of the surrounding hallway. Tapping his flight suit glove on the door, a *hiss* followed as July was buzzed into the office. 

The office was a wide open space. Artificial sunlight from a faux skylight above bathed the room in bright white light. Of course the Stanton Star wasn't far away from here, but any external doors or windows would compromise the security of the facility. 

Squared furniture dotted the room, and data screens and holographic displays lined the right side wall. In the center of the room, at a large desk with a holographic map of Stanton, featuring various symbols at various points, sat a heavy set man wearing a white and gold suit with olive drab accents.
July thought the suit and office were both ridiculous. But March insisted on his own style of luxury mixed with militarism. 

March looked up over his holographic display at July. “How’d it go?” he asked, an eyebrow raised. “The pilot did not survive. The ship is destroyed. Finis Temporis performed just as expected, as it always does.” July reported in his military standard bearing, muscle memory from his UEE days.
“Do you think this will have the anticipated effect?”
“Yes. Especially considering the Finis Temporis’ Regeneration Jammer was active when the pilot was killed, I would anticipate the desired reaction by NOVA. They now should realize we can, and will kill them, if they do not leave us alone.”
“Do you think this will provoke them into full scale war?”

“Well. They could try. But against what? They only know the locations of our most insignificant bases, and we’re evacuating and relocating all of them as we speak. They could ramp up for war if they want, but they will exhaust themselves within a few months and we can resume full scale ops. Until then, we operate a little more carefully, in more distinctly civilian ships, with civilians on board.” July said, confident his military action was the correct decision. 

“I took your word on this one, July. I came to you for help and asked the best way to get them to stop harassing our bases. Now you tell me they will harass us *more*?” March thundered, standing his 3 meter figure up from his desk.

“Yeeeesss… They might. But it will be far *easier* to track them in full battle groups, than guerilla formations. We track and avoid, operate at a slightly reduced capacity, maybe fight a few proxy battles. They’ll tire themselves out or find a bigger enemy. Then we’re right as rain!” July boasted.

“You’re the newest of the Elites, July. You know what’s at stake here.”
“Yes, sir. And like I told September, I'll tell you. I’ve seen NOVA from the inside, and I know what they'll do in response to a strike like this. They value their members’ lives highly. They also *refuse* to allow for collateral damage. So we scale back *slightly*, we operate intertwined with Civvies, and we’re *good*!”
“You know operating with civilian meat shields also includes possible security compromises, right?” March fired back.
“Well we don’t have to *keep* the civilians after we’re done.”
“**Well**, we can’t just have the UEE knocking down doors once hundreds of civilians start disappearing each week.”
“Okay so we just add a couple proxy layers, minimize spent shields, and we’ll run pure ships back and forth from our actual main locations. Happy?”
“Ugh. I still don’t know why I approved this strike. But I guess you’ve pulled it off before.
As long as they reduce their strikes on our bases, and that more than makes up for the additional cost of these *proxies and meat shields* you are now necessitating, I'll call it acceptable. ” March conceded, sitting back in his seat.
July nodded, acknowledging that any further conversation would likely not go in his favor, he turned towards the door.

“One last thing.” March said. By the time July turned around, March was standing in front of his desk. 
“Hm?” July inquired.
“They promoted that Cepheus of yours to Wing Commander, and Archangel to Admiral… That means they will have access to more resources. Cepheus has seen you before, maybe not your face, but your ship. It’s not unlikely that they will come after us, or maybe even *you*, now that you killed one of their pilots.” March stated matter of factly. 
“I’m not worried about Cepheus, or Archangel. I’ve bested Cepheus before, and Archangel has never got close. Neither of them have a clue where we are, who we are, or what we have.” 
“I sense some cockeyness in you.”
“I sense doubt in *you*.”
March rolled his eyes.
“Be careful with that. You bested Cepheus with an EMP from a few clicks out before he even detected you. And *you* haven't got close to Archangel. Don’t underestimate him. You’ve heard from McCricik about Archangel’s resolve and abilities.” March said, stepping towards July. He continued,
“You know as well as I do that NOVA might be the first actual *threat* to the Kilian Syndicate in a hundred years. **Don’t** underestimate them. We can beat them, but we must avoid full open combat. Little one versus one executions will only work so many times before they get wise to your tricks and toys. We need to do what we have always done. Stay under the radar, make our money, live to profit another day.” March said, placing a hand on July’s shoulder.
“Don’t fuck up a good thing for the sake of your pride.”

July nodded, swallowing hard, a pang of anger building up inside him. 
“Good. Go get some food from Mess and report back tomorrow morning for your next assignment.” March said, turning back towards his desk.
“See you tomorrow, sir.” July said with veiled contempt, as he exited the office.
