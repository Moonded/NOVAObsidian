**PART 2 of 3**

I stood fully armored, save for the helmet, in my Artimex suit in the workshop section of my MSR, where the data banks used to be kept. The 3D printer was in the process of fabricating an upgrade module for my cybernetic, which I’ve been concepting for a few days now. It turns out it’s pretty convenient when your significant other is a systems engineer for Crusader, with lots of connections in Microtech and their Cybernetics Division. 

Unfortunately the module won’t be completed before my mission here is done. Have to get it installed after. 
I looked over the fabricator display screen, which showed the blueprints for an extendable blade, hidden in the forearm of a cybernetic limb. The design would take some adaptation of the cybernetic itself, as the limb is a civilian model. But I’ll pop by New Babbage to one of Cassie’s friends to see what they can do. 
Pyro will be the last time I’ll be caught defenseless. 
Like a phoenix… To rise from the ashes. Or whatever cringey shit I’ll come up with next. 

Satisfied with the progress of the fabrication, I turned to the door to the cockpit and went through. Down the corridor I met the weapon rack, which held my trusty S71 Rifle, S38 pistol, and Demon Fang combat knife.

I brushed my hand across the top of my Artimex helmet which sat atop the empty Copilot seat. The visor flicked from red to green in a smooth wave, indicating systems nominal. 
I sat in the pilot chair and activated it, the seat then turning and sliding up the rail to the front of the cockpit.
Amid the swirls of Cherenkov radiation, the orange ball of pollution Hurston grew in the cockpit glass. The orange and brown marble grew and grew until the ship exited quantum travel with a *whooorsh*, tendrils of blue light fading as the energy dissipated.

The MSR’s maneuvering thrusters came back online and I maneuvered the ship to point towards Aberdeen, the even oranger, more miserable moon of Hurston. 

Activating QT, the red and black Mercury Star Runner lurched towards Aberdeen, the small orb growing to a large moon.

Again exiting QT, the ship’s thrusters all reactivated. The coordinates that Archangel gave me were about 753 km from my current position.  A quick QT to the closer orbital marker would shorten my transit, but QT generates a ton of emissions, and I am strict stealth protocol from here on out.
I flip the red switch on the center console labeled “SILENT RUNNING”, and the ship shudders as shield generators, which had only just spooled up upon exiting QT, shut back down and secured. Extra thrust nozzle shielding moved into place, vectoring flaps articulating through their self checks to allow for reduced maneuvering thruster usage. The cockpit glass darkened as well, to limit IR emissions from the ship’s interior. Interior lights darkened from bright white to a dim red, and the power plant reduced its output to follow. 

I activated the MSR’s powerful scanning array, the satellite dish on the roof of the ship extending. I accelerated to full speed towards the waypoint, scanning ahead as I made my way towards the coordinates. 

Scanning both visually, and in every electromagnetic and light spectrum known, the space around Aberdeen and this cursed cave appeared empty. 

Entering Aberdeen’s thick atmosphere, a HUD element popped up above one of the MFD’s notifying me that the ship’s exterior was heating up. I flicked another switch on the center console, activating the ship’s front shield face at a low power, to prevent the heating.
The increased EM emission from the shield would total less than the increased IR from atmospheric entry.

The sulfur dioxide atmosphere buffeted the front of the MSR as it descended towards the superheated surface. Now slowed and deep into the atmosphere, I deactivated the front shield, emissions now minimal. 

Approaching the cave’s location using minimal thrust, the MSR’s semi-aerodynamic shape and thrust vectoring assisting in stealthy flight, scans still turned up nothing. Satisfied I deactivated all active scanners, using just passive now to reduce emissions even further still. 
The cave came into distant view, now 15km away. Stanton’s harsh light and heat bombarded the cave entrance. Winds blew up dust all around, reducing visibility. 

I decided the possibility of a Syndicate scout was too great to expose myself fully. I decided to land the ship about 14km from the cave entrance. I’ll have to hoof it from here. I brought the ship down gracefully to a small surface clearing, the lower maneuvering thrusters activating once the ship slowed down too much to sufficiently lift the large vessel.
A small dust cloud was kicked up as the landing legs contacted the ground, the engines automatically shutting down as the Weight On Gear sensor was activated. Stealth protocol.

A final check of the passive scanners came back clean. Satisfied I pushed the button to slide my pilot seat backwards, and I stood up. I grabbed my helmet from the copilot chair, placed it over my head, and watched the digital display come alive.
Red graphics flashed as the various systems and widgets came alive. Connections to cybernetics, ship, weapons, and the rest of the suit came alive and read green. Nutrition, hydration, oxygen capacity, and ammo capacity all read good for a 14 kilometer journey… each way. Luckily for me the gravity here was significantly less than a full scale planet, meaning although this trek might be lengthy, it shouldn’t be too tiring. 

I flicked through my helmet’s different vision modes, ensuring I’d be able to see through the dust storms, should they become an issue. I equipped my S71, S38, and Demon Fang on outer mag hardpoints, and a couple extra water packets inside the interior suit compartments. 

Normal vision mode, reduced HUD, systems check. Good to go. I made my way through the ship, to the cargo bay, and opened the rear hatch.
As the ramp opened and met Aberdeen’s surface, hot sulfuric air rushed into the cargo bay, buffeting my suit. My helmet’s external vents shut with a *thump*, a metallic taste now indicating I was breathing filtered, tanked air. A temperature readout flashed, indicating 230 degrees celsius exterior temperature. That's hot as shit but this suit can take it. For long enough anyways. 

I walked down the ramp and onto the dusty surface. A few meters away, I pulled up a widget for ship control in my HUD, closed the ramp, and commanded the ship to launch into orbit, and QT a random distance from the planet. Undetectable by anyone, or anything. 

The coordinate location popped up on my HUD as a navigation waypoint. I turned my head to that direction and noticed the Stanton sun setting just beyond a couple hills past the cave. 

Into the night we go.
