PART 7 OF 12**


I carefully and painstakingly wrestle the Mustang Delta over towards the hangar marked in the Nav computer. After a few minutes of flying through space at slow speeds, traveling the vast distances of Ruin Station, I was getting fatigued just trying to keep the unassisted ship stable. 

Various warnings and annunciations flashed across the HUD and flight displays as I made my way. Power fluctuations, cooler failures, overheats, low thruster line pressures, etc. It reminded me of my initial pilot training when the simulator instructor would give you a scenario with an impossible number of failures and expect you to *somehow* get the ship out in one piece.

As I reach 1 km from the designated landing hangar, I see its massive doors begin to slide open. I line up the Mustang and, still struggling to keep it level, approach the now opened hangar. 

The interior of the hangar was dark, and empty. No personnel, no lighting, no boxes, no graffiti… which I found particularly strange. Ruin is covered in graffiti. 

I flip on the landing lights; or maybe I should say “landing light”, as only one was working. The struggling LED lit the pad enough for me to approach. As the Delta crossed the air shield into the hangar, I could feel the rush of wind cool the exterior of my Stoneskin undersuit, my helmet’s HUD now reading a breathable atmosphere. 

I set down the Mustang Delta ungraciously on the pad, a loud THUNK reverberating through the disturbingly empty hangar. 
I shut down the engines, but left the master power online… Just in case. 

I press the button to pop the canopy open, the entry/exit ladder automatically extending. The dashboard moves forward to allow room for me to exit the craft. I stand from the pilot’s chair, and lean back behind the pilot seat, reaching for the little black box stuck in the crevice behind. 

I grab it, and then climb carefully down the ladder. The still lit singular landing LED on the Mustang is all that illuminated this hangar. The external microphones on the StoneSkin helmet automatically increased their Gain to tune into any sounds that may be happening, but it was silent, all except for some miscellaneous creaks and groans that could be heard on any space station.
I tuck the box under my right arm and pull the S-38 pistol off my left thigh, my helmet’s HUD automatically populating with a “S-38 Pistol, Ammunition 15/30”, and showing status green across all HUD indicators. One full magazine in the weapon, and two full magazines on my waist. I hope 45 bullets will be enough for whatever could be waiting for me outside this hangar. 

I make my way to the elevator at the hangar’s exit, my pistol held carefully by my side. I don’t want to be instantly shot by whatever’s on the other side, in case they see me as a threat. Defensive use only… I suppose.

I press the “Call Elevator” button next to the rusty yellow doors, and it instantly opens. That means it was waiting here for me… This shit is getting too creepy man. I just want to go home. 

I enter the empty elevator, one light lit in the ceiling, flickering on and off. My StoneSkin helmet’s flashlight automatically turning on.

I move to the control panel for the elevator, and a chill goes down my spine when I see what floor options there are.

“HANGAR 13” (Present Floor)
“DONT FUCK WITH THE NINE TAILS”
“OPEN DOORS”

Well… Seems I have one option.

I press the middle option, sending me to the only other destination available here.
It’s becoming hard to recall exactly what happened during that elevator ride. A bit too much was running through my mind at once. A bit of triggered PTSD perhaps… 
I arrive at the explicitly titled floor, and the doors hiss open. I raise my pistol a couple inches instinctively and hold the box tightly under my right arm.
The room before me was a dimly lit lobby area, some inoperative ASOP terminals along the walls and in the center of the room. It was obvious this was the previous lobby to the hangars and has since been taken over by the… well… the Nine Tails.

I enter the lobby, seeing nobody around, hearing nothing. I wander cautiously through the graffiti covered lobby, passing by the rust, the blood, the flickering lights. 
I come to a hallway, with a row of doors, all closed and locked. Except for one. It had an illuminated room number sign, reading “Room 6”. Startlingly, a Nav marker popped up on my helmet’s HUD the second I looked at it, pointing straight towards the room.

I guess my helmet’s software did sync to the ship, and retrieved some of the navigation data during the flight. Still scared me a bit. My finger twitched towards the trigger of the S-38.

I approach the door, and it opens a few steps before the motion sensors usually trigger.
Inside I see a brightly lit room, with four people in it. 
“Ah! You’ve finally arrived!” The first man, standing near the door says. 
“Come in! We’ve been waiting!”
