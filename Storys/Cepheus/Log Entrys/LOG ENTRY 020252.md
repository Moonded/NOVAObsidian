Well due to some scheduling conflicts, the meeting with ArchangelCorps got pushed back about a week and a half, but such is life with folks like these. Gave me more time to work on myself and my equipment, as well as get some much needed days of rest with the new girlfriend I’d got myself.

  

Anyhow, A couple days before the meeting with Archangel happened, a Wing Commander requested to meet up with me in NOVA HQ. I did as such and they promoted me to Commander In Training! I guess they have taken notice of how I performed during the Orphanage raid and other operations. Either way I'm honored to have the opportunity.

  

The meeting with Arch went well. I Hadn’t even received my new CIT pin yet. Lots of promotions lately so sometimes the badges take a few days. That's a good problem to have though, NOVA needs lots of good solid leadership.

  

Bandader, also at the meeting, basically requested I be present to make sure Arch doesn't bring in Malachite in a body bag. Unfortunately I want him in a body bag just as much, but I do have some self control. At worst I'll pin him in my HUD as “ESSENTIAL PLS DON'T SHOOT”.

  

At the same time Bandader announced that this Orphanage related task force, rather now the team assigned to take down the group behind the Orphanage, is named Task Force Azrael. I am sure this had to do with my CIT promotion, as the timings were almost the same.

  

Either way we left the meeting with the assignment to locate Malachite. This won't be easy I'm sure, but he couldn't have gone too far.

  

Arch had the excellent idea to contact Hal, the guy who I originally learned of Malachite from. Now he and I are not friends. Last time I saw him he shot me. I had been undercover as a buyer of his illegal goods when I tried to arrest him. He sadly got the jump on me and got away. I'm tempted to not even try, but hey, what do I have to lose? More of my dignity?

So here I am now, sitting in the chair in the captain’s quarters in the Point Of No Return, bringing up my mobiglas to attempt to call Hal.

  

Ring..... Riiing.... Riiing.... Riiing... ......... Click

Welp. I tried.

I shrugged and got up from my Captain’s chair, and walked over to my bed and laid down. It sure is nice to be out of armor and in regular clothes. Comfortable ones nonetheless. I know people question my decision to not show my face, but I have my reasons.

I looked over to the photo of Cassie I have next to my bed. We’ve been together a couple months now, and I've hardly told anyone about her. Another one of those “always keep your friends at arm's length” habits I've kept from my smuggling days. The more people know about you the more they can use against you.

  

Anyways... Mobiglas chimes with an incoming call

Oh. Wow. Guess who...... Hal.

I answer the call. “Well well... I didn't expect you to call me. Not after I nearly ended your life.” Hal said, in a groggy voice. Was he asleep? It's mid afternoon. I guess that is relative. It's hard to remember time zones exist when you travel star systems regularly.

  

“Yeah man. I know we aren't friends, but I'm sure you’ve read the news lately.” I responded to him, trying to put on a friendly voice. “Of course. I did see NOVA took down the Orphanage. Some good work there. Although I suspect you are trying to tie up a loose end... Or get more information perhaps?” Hal replied, a tinge of condescension in his voice. “Yeah. Malachite. I need his whereabouts.” I said, straight forward. No sense in beating up the bush while Hal waits for the funniest time to hang up on me.

  

“I can't say I know anything. Even if I did, those guys would have my head if I told you, and that's ASSUMING I knew something.” Hal said, a bit of anxiousness seeming to surface towards the end of his sentence. “Those guys...? So you know about more than just Malachite?” I said.

“Now now, I didn't say nothing about nobody.” Hal replied, now clearly anxious.

  

“Okay. That's fine. Just remember I still have a warrant out on you. I might be willing to overlook it if you tell me what you know about the organization. Or at least the vicinity of Malachite...” I said, promptly hanging up before he could respond. Have to leave 'em hanging a little. Truthfully I haven't the faintest where Hal is. I just know it's either night or early morning and he’s on a planet, and has been for a while. Most spacefarers sync their body clocks to UTC. Easier that way. Space stations do too. So the fact he was groggy at this hour suggests to me he is on a planet with his body clock synced to their local time zone.

  

Only three planets he could be doing that on. Crusaders Day/Night cycle is too fast for someone to abide by a time zone, and the only large habitable place there is Orison, and it’s lunch time there. Hurston’s main city is Lorville, and it’s about midnight there. His voice was rough, kinda like he’d been smoking a pack a day, as the oldies would say. Considering the air quality there, Lorville is a good candidate.

  

Arccorp is a whole damn planet covered in city, so that's a crap shoot. He could be anywhere on the planet. But the lack of background noise in his call’s audio suggests he was somewhere

reasonably quiet. Arccorp is notoriously noisy, between the airborne traffic everywhere, to the advertisements that blast noise outside all day and night.

  

Microtech is the final option. There’s a few places he could be there, some of which the times would line up. So that’s possible. I'm thinking Lorville is the most likely, but with Microtech also being possible, I need to run this through NOVA intel. NOVA has a contract with Microtech which allows us to bounty hunt in their system. This also gives us limited access to their comm relays. We could potentially check the logs of my call through those relays to see if it shows up. If it does, he is on MT. We may even get a pretty tight location. If there are no logs, either he is really good at hiding himself, or he is on Lorville.

  

I'll forward this to NOVA Intel and relay my findings to Archangel and Bandader at the same time.

That's going to take some time though. I think it's high time I flew back to Orison and spent some time at home. Greencircle is still my favorite place in Stanton. That's also where Cassie lives. I did get a few days with her recently, but I'll never turn down more.

  

While I'm getting some R and R, I'm going to contact Italina. Over the past week, Archangel did get back to me about the marked pictures he retrieved from The Orphanage. Bandader has authorized me to share those pictures if it’s for the greater benefit of our mission. Italina was very adamant about wanting them and I think I can use them as leverage to get some additional stealth modifications to my 400i, and maybe even my 325a. That kind of gear could certainly help Archangel and I on our upcoming missions.

  

I get up from my bed and walk into the hallway. I don't often get to fly from the pilot seat wearing basically night clothes, but damn it I want to be comfortable.

I sit in the pilot seat, power on the engines,and take a long look at Arccorp. I always love the tiny little specs of traffic rapidly moving about in Arccorp’s lower atmosphere. Makes me feel big, and small at the same time.

  

I check the engines are properly warmed, and orient the ship to point towards Crusader. I spool the QT drive and activate. The drive kicks in with a WOOSH, space compresses off the nose, and the Point Of No Return and myself are launched towards Crusader at 78% the speed of light.
