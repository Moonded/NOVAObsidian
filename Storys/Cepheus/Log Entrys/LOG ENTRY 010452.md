OFFICIAL ORPHANAGE ASSAULT OPERATION DEBRIEF, INTENDED FOR DOLBI, NOVA ADMIRAL. CLASSIFIED

  

I brought the Point Of No Return from Area 18 up to Bajini Point, where I linked up with Bandader and a small group that answered our call. It was a nicely sized task force.

  

Bandader gave us a thorough briefing and we went over the plan. We were to join an already set up overwatch, led by ArchangelCorps, and then two teams were to assault the main Orphanage building.

I was assigned by Bandader to lead one of those teams.

  

We finished the briefing and loaded up two ships. Fast forwarding past the rather uneventful trip, we landed about 6km from the Orphanage. We disembarked with 3 Cyclones, 2 people each. I mounted the gun of a cyclone driven by Max. We drove the 6 km distance, rounding a mountain.

  

As we came around the mountain and got eyes on the Orphanage, as well as the Freelancer that was parked by it, the transport that the Rookie got captured on, no doubt. As we continued forward, Max spotted a god damn Nova Tank! I have no idea what kind of operation we’ve found, but if they have a tank... that’s serious business. The tank spotted us almost immediately and started firing shells at us. Knowing my tiny Size 1 ballistic gatling wouldn't touch the tank, I could only watch as Max expertly evaded the fire. It was inevitable however that eventually the tank landed a shot quite close behind us, and shrapnel from the high explosive shell shattered our rear left wheel.

  

Luckily for us, at that moment, our other ground team laid into the tank with heavy fire. Our cyclone disgracefully ground to a stop, knowing we had a very small window to disembark the cyclone before the tank finished us off, Max and I jumped out and ran behind some rocks for cover. I unholstered my C54 SMG, and signaled Max to follow.

  

Archangel and his teammate were set up on the mountain overlooking the Orphanage with snipers, Bandader encountered hostile infantry fire as he approached the Orphanage ahead of Max and I.

  

Max got a visual on one of the infantry targets assaulting Bandader’s team, and fired some shots but they were well outside of effective range.

As the hostile tank and infantry focused their fire on Bandader’s team, Max and I pushed forward to the main building.

  

The Nova Tank was engaging Bandader’s team when suddenly it turned and drove away from us, out of the valley. Neither myself nor Max had any idea why it would do that, but considering it did not pose a threat anymore, we decided to not look our gift horse in the mouth and continue on our mission.

  

Max caught sight of another hostile to our 10 o’clock, to the left of the main building, and fired some shots, injuring them.

Just as the target popped out from behind a rock he was using for cover, Archangel took him down with his sniper.

  

Bandader and his team breached the Orphanage building, cleared the inside and discovered a group of about 8 children inside, ages 6 to 12. The Rookie was there too. They were all a bit worse for wear. Seemed to be suffering some sort of drug withdrawal, I’m not a medic though.

  

Determining we needed to exfil the children and The Rookie ASAP, Bandader made the call to exit and clear the remaining area outside, as Archangel was reporting some hostiles remained on the far side of the parked Freelancer, relative to the building.

  

Four of us lined up in the building airlock, ready to exit once the doors were opened.

Airlock cycled.

Max and I went left, Bandader and his team mate went right.

Max exited and opened fire on two hostiles behind the freelancer.

I took incoming fire from the rightmost target. Five bullets struck my armor, and 2 of them penetrated into my left arm and abdomen.

A flurry of warnings lit up my HUD as I returned fire, not hitting anything of course

I retreated back into the orphanage building, my vision rapidly becoming blurry.

I crouched just inside of the airlock, cycled it to regain pressure to better tend my wounds, and pulled my med gun from my left leg mag mount, and used it to evaluate my injuries.

  

Just fleshwounds. But my blood pressure was dropping. My arm wound was not bleeding severely, so most of it must have been in my abdomen. God I hate getting shot.

  

The med gun computer calculated a healing solution that would patch me up enough to finish the engagement and make it to the nearest medical facility.

  

I applied the treatment and the gun sealed my suit at the bullet holes, applied a congealant to my abdomen wounds, and tidied up the rest. Again, I’m not a medic.

  

With my pain dulled, but not gone, and bullets pinging off the walls of the Orphanage building, I got to my feet and exited the airlock again. My suit diagnostics showed Vacuum ready, and I returned outside. I saw a hostile about 500m from the doorway, behind the freelancer again. I unloaded a clip from my C54, my suit computer registering hits, but the target did not go down.

The hostile rose back up from cover and opened fire on me. I can see incendiary tracer rounds whizzing over my head.

  

I just barely get down in time and then I hear “Target down, I got you Ceph”, from Arch on the comms. I'm really starting to like that guy.

  

I hear a yell over the radio and turn to my left to see a NOVA Marine being gunned down by the final remaining Orphanage operative. The hostile was quickly dispatched by one of Bandader’s Team, but the Marine fell to the ground and his comm’s went silent.

  

Confident the hostile was killed, double checking with a couple extra taps, the teammate returned to the Marine to evaluate his condition.

“He’s dead.” The teammate said.

Damn. We couldn't get through unscathed could we?

It’s not the end of the world, the Marine should have had his Imprint backed up at Bajini station. But he’ll still be out of commission for a couple days. Nevertheless, he should be fine.

  

A couple minutes later, after we’d verified the entire compound was clear, Archangel’s teammate brought in a Pisces snub ship onto the compound, and we loaded the children aboard.

I followed them along with Max and The Rookie, getting ‘priority transport’ due to my injuries. We took off and flew back to Bajini, where NOVA command, along with a team of medics were waiting to take the children for treatment.

  

Archangel and his team elected to stay on location at the Orphanage to look for evidence and information about this whole operation. It was quite small considering the legend it’d gathered. This is undoubtedly a small piece of this puzzle.

You’ll have to ask Arch what he found.

  

If you’ll excuse me, I have a little bit of healing up to do before I can get back to my duties. Nazvegnyama has requested my presence aboard his ship once I’m recovered, and apparently has some news for me.

I wonder what he will have to say.
