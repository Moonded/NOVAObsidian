“Come in! We’ve been waiting!” the man at the door says. He’s wearing civilian clothing, doesn’t appear to be armed, and seems deceptively friendly. 

I lower my pistol to my side but keep it in my hand, and approach the door. Moment of truth.

I enter the room, the first man stepping aside. Inside I see some chairs and a couch, plus a large table. There's one heavy set guy standing in the corner, no weapons in hand, but I’d suspect there's some hidden on him under his leather jacket. Then there’s two gentlemen sitting on the couch in the middle of the room, against the back wall, One is wearing a fancy suit, with a subtle Nine Tails logo emblazoned on the tie. The other guy is wearing a worker’s outfit, coveralls and all, slightly dirty, as if he just started his shift. A hard hat is sitting on the table in the middle, obviously belonging to the man.
What seem to be clean lines through the dust on his cheeks are evidence of dried tears. 

I say nothing, but enter and look around the room. 
“I’d made the call to September yesterday about this! Take your damn time don’t you?” the man by the door said. I look at him and shrug. “I had to improvise my own transport.” I say, trying to hide any semblance of fear in my voice, likely to little success.
“I see… Put the box on the table please.” the man says. “And for the love of God please put that pistol away. I’d hate to see you get hurt.” The man continues. I do as he says and then step back to the corner of the room furthest from any of the men. 

As I back away I notice the door man’s eyes lock onto my face, undoubtedly noticing my scar, and they stick there for a moment before looking back to the box. 

“All yours Clancy.” the door man says. 
“Yes. Well.” the man called Clancy says, the one sitting on the couch with the worker, wearing a suit. He featured thick, shoulder length white hair, a clean shaven face, Ninetails tattoos on all visible skin, and a slightly wrinkled complexion suggesting he’s in his forties to fifties in age.
He picks up the box off the table and sets it in his lap.
“Remember how we said there would be consequences for not paying us back in time?” Clancy says to the worker on the couch next to him. He nods, and new tears begin to roll down his face. 

I stand uncomfortably in the corner, determining it is my time to leave. I turn and head towards the exit. 
The heavy set man in the far corner steps quickly to the door and grabs me by the shoulder. “Oh no, you should stay to watch this. It’s our favorite part.” He says in a deep gravelly voice. Obviously I have no choice, so I turn and stand back in my corner.
“I told you, just give me until tomorrow!” The worker said. 
“You said that yesterday Dennis.” Clancy replied. 
“I had to fix Chloe’s Aurora, you see! She needs it for her job…” Dennis replies, more tears streaming down his face. 
“Yes, I know. That’s why you took the loan from us in the first place.” Clancy says, his voice becoming more stern.
“It required more work than anticipated…” Dennis says quietly.
“And sadly so did you…” Clancy replies.
“Here, a present for you.” he adds, handing the black box to Dennis. 

Dennis grabs it with shaky hands, placing it on his lap and then wiping his eyes dry. 
He presses a button on the top of the box, followed by a *hiss*, then a *pop*, as the lit unsealed and unlatched from the box. 

He removes the lid and drops it. “No…” he says, barely able to contain himself.
“You BASTARDS!” he yells. “Due dates are not suggestions Dennis. You were told of this before you took our money.” Clancy says, placing a hand on Dennis’ shoulder. 

Dennis throws off Clancy’s hand, tears dripping into the box. He puts his hands to his face and breaks down, sobbing loudly, the box falls off his lap and onto the ground.
[TRIGGER WARNING, GRAPHIC CONTENT]
||It tips over and what rolls out turns my blood to ice. 
It was a head. A blonde, young female. Maybe eighteen?
She bore the same scar that was on my face, freshly carved beneath her cheek. Her eyes open, blue and bloodshot. 

Dennis fell to his knees beside the couch, grabbing the head off the floor and clutching it tightly. “Not my Chloe…” he says between sobs. 

Clancy stands up, signals to the heavy set guard in the far corner, who approaches, draws a Coda pistol from his jacket and hands it to Clancy.

“I hate it had to end this way Dennis. But as we tell everyone with which we deal, don’t fuck with the Nine Tails.” He says, raising the pistol and pulling the trigger, boring a .50 caliber hole through Dennis’ head. 

I audibly gasp and cringe at the gunshot, turning my head.
As Dennis’ lifeless body fell to the floor, the head rolling away as his limp arms let it go.|| I turn and make my way quickly to the door. This time the guard was too busy laughing to stop me.

I exit the room and begin to sprint to the hangar door, to get back to my Mustang.
I reach the elevator and punch the Hangar 13 button.
The elevator whirrs as it sends me to the dark hangar. 
The elevator stops and the doors open, the dark hangar presents itself to me, the Mustang still sitting just as I’d left it, a single landing light scattering light across the hangar. 

I exit the hangar and walk quickly towards my ship.
That’s when an all too familiar, nightmarish voice called out behind me. 
“Where do you think you’re going, Cepheus?”
