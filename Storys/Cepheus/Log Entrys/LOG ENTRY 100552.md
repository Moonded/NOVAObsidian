I watched as the front cargo bay ramp closed on the NSS Emelia, Archangel turning to walk back to the bridge no doubt, as the ramp cut off my line of sight to him. The massive ship’s engines lit, and the wind from the massive idling maneuvering thrusters stirred up the Aeroview hangar. I heard the whistle of the wind rush against my Artimex helmet. The massive hydraulic doors at the roof of the hangar started to open, and I decided to turn around and exit the hangar before the Carrack lifted off and would undoubtedly knock me off my feet.

Just as I entered the elevator I felt the rumble of the Carrack’s engines spooling up beneath my feet. Just as the elevator doors close, the Carrack lifts off. The wind rush into the elevator is significant, and my helmet HUD flashes a yellow triangle indicating a noise hazard and automatically dampens the exterior microphones.

I take the elevator to the August Dunlow Spaceport, and ride the shuttle to Cloudview Center. I noticed several people throughout my journey staring at my armor… Maybe red visored Artimex is a bit… flashy? Eh. 

I arrive at GreenCircle habs, where Cassie and I’s apartment is. 
I walk up to our apartment and open the door. She’s sitting on the living room couch watching some random documentary about some serial killer on Terra. The door closes behind me and I remove my helmet. My eyes met hers. Tears welled up in both our eyes as she ran up to me and embraced me. 

We spoke of how we missed each other. I sat down on the couch with her and she ran her fingers over the hole in my chestplate from where I’d thrown the Demon Fang into Borlathar’s heart. I’d patched that hole of course, but the faintest mark remained, and Cass has quite an eye for details like that. Her hand moved and grasped my now mechanical right arm. It was covered by my Artimex, but I knew she could feel the solidity of the metal limb.

“The Verse hasn’t been kind to you, has it…?” She said, her fingers now wrapping around my cybernetic hand. My face rushed red and I felt tears welling up…. I-... **[RECORDING PAUSES]**

**[RECORDING RESUMES]** Some time later, I’d finally got out of my armor and into normal clothes, and had spent a few hours telling Cass all about my experience in Pyro, the destruction of the Point Of No Return, my interrogation by NOVA upon my return, and my discussions with Archangel aboard the Emelia. 

She seemed upset I wasn’t… “whole” anymore, considering the arm. I can’t lie… I’m upset about it too. Luckily for me, I’m left handed. I’ve adapted well to the arm though. It’s adapted to me as well… There’s some learning algorithms in the firmware that drive the articulation interfaces. It helps the cybernetic learn your natural movement patterns over time, to better interpret the signals it receives from your body. 

I think she was mainly happy to see me alive though. She is used to me being gone for extended periods for my work with NOVA, and she knows I had an apartment in Area 18 for that purpose. She had known I was stuck in Pyro, as I’d contacted her via Mobi briefly the second I got back to Stanton. But she didn’t know just how on the edge of getting myself killed I was for so long. 

We spent a long, long time catching up. I really needed the heart to heart to be honest. 
I needed to feel the touch of someone I could trust. 

I consider myself lucky to have that here. 

“So what are you going to do next?” She asks me as we lay together in bed, the TV playing the show that she always waits for me to watch. 

“I’ve put in an order for a new ship with ShaRroos, if you remember her. Then… I’ve got some work to do before NOVA clears me back into the TF:A operations.” I reply, gazing over to the pulsing orange light on my Artimex helmet, which indicates it’s performing data uploads.

“Work?” 

“Yeah…”

“Dangerous work?”

“Yeah…”

“You know I don’t want to lose you, right? I would appreciate it if you could try to not get yourself in direct harm’s way for like, two weeks…” 
“I know babe. It’s important work, I promise.” 

“It better be.” She huffs, turning back to the TV. 

We watched our show for a while. Then when it ended, we checked the time to see it was late.
“God damn, I’m so ready to finally sleep in my own bed.” I said. 
“Come on then! I hate sleeping alone too… It’s a specific kind of cold, you know?” Cass replied. 

We got ready for bed together, and I laid down in what might be the softest bed I think I’ve ever felt. I think I was asleep before my head even hit the pillow… and damn that was the best sleep of my entire life.
