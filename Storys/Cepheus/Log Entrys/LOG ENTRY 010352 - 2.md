I had returned from the meeting with Italina’s contact. He had given me the information without actually asking for payment, which I thought was interesting. It contained the flight plan for the Freelancer, which contained a good candidate for exact coordinates of the Orphanage among other valuable information. I forwarded all of this to BandaderArten and he sent out a briefing shortly thereafter.

  

I really need to sleep, man.

  

I grabbed my weapons out of my safe and geared up. I checked their link with my armor’s HUD and stowed them on their magnetic mounts. Per Bandader’s briefing, I'm expected to lead a team in the assault. His point was that I’ve gathered much of the intel we have on the Orphanage operation, which is a good point. Damn I still hate CQC combat though. I’ve got this though. Hell I might even have a promotion on the other side of this, plus my imprint is still quite fresh, so it’s relatively low risk anyways. Famous last words, right?

  

I head out of my apartment and to the starport. I call the Point Of No Return to a hangar and hop in. I flip the appropriate switches and she flickers to life. I call for departure, the hangar doors open, and up and away I go. Rendezvous point is Bajini Station. T-143 seconds to arrival. It’s time to take these assholes down.
