LOG ENTRY: #081952
DATE: 08/16/2952
MISSION CLOCK: 1D, 6H, 42M.
N-ID: 615997 - Commander - Wraiths
CALLSIGN: CEPHEUS 
NAME: ERR 
SYSTEM: STANTON
SHIP: NSS POINT OF NO RETURN - ORIGIN 400i
LOCATION: QT TO ARCCORP FROM CRUSADER

    The good ol’ hum of the quantum drive. My favorite sound reverberating throughout my bespoke 400i as I stare at the peculiar boxes of *something* sitting in the cargo bay. Just yesterday I had intercepted a distress call from a Freelancer Max which had been attacked by pirates. 

 I rescued the sole survivor and recovered some boxes of cargo, which the pirates had seemed awfully desperate to collect, although something had made them abandon the site in a hurry. That resulted in them leaving some cargo behind. 

I had dropped off the survivor, who I had come to know as Reece Cedwin during our short time together, with ArchangelCorps at the NSS Emilia. I had also left a couple of the cargo containers recovered from the ship with him. The rest I am currently transporting to NOVA HQ on ArcCorp. 

This box makes me feel uneasy, you know? The metals are just… too black. Too polished. For being arranged in the box as if they were tossed in like simple scrap metal, this shit looks like it’d be worth a couple hundred thousand UEC. 

Nevertheless… I gotta transport it. … It almost feels like my old smuggling days. Some inexplicably valuable box of miscellaneous *stuff*, which I definitely don't want to know about. Except… While the cargo may be illicit, technically, my mission is not. 

I hear the signature pitch change in the quantum drive as it begins to decelerate. We must be approaching ArcCorp. Good. I put the lid of the container back on and seal it closed, pat it a couple times as if it’s some animate object and sigh as I run my fingers through my hair. “Let’s get you in our analyst’s hands, alright?” I mumble, as if I’m speaking to the box.  I make my way up the elevator and into the upper deck of the No Return, then heading into the bridge. I sit down in the pilot seat and as my Mobi Contact lens HUD blinks off, the ship’s HUD quickly comes to life. 

I notice my ship’s velocity is now slow enough as if it’s about to drop out of QT, but the distance to ArcCorp is still reading in excess of 1 million kilometers. “That's strange…” I mumble when the ship drops out of quantum. I give a cursory glance to the ship's systems. All systems green, no contacts on the sensors… Quiet…

I tap the holographic panel on the right a few times to begin a quantum drive diagnostic. Something may have bugged the navigation computer. These avionics computers are all programmed to drop out of QT *really* early in the event of any navigational bugs. Would rather have to make a secondary jump than end up quantumed into a planet at 50% the speed of light. 

I begin the QT diagnostic, all systems coming back green one by one.
Quantum core… Fuel injectors… Density matrix… Navigation databases… Alcubierre field generator… All gre-... “CONTACT” The Point Of No Return verbally annunciated to me. My eyes shoot to the radar, where a white blip appeared for just a split second before vanishing.
“That’s not good…” I said out loud. A ghost contact out in deep space is rare. In atmosphere sure, you get random pings from atmospheric disturbances, solar radiation, weather phenomena, etc. But in deep space… It’d have to be a stray particle hitting just the right transistor… And all that stuff is shielded anywa- “CONTACT” The ship said again brashly. “CONTACT, CONTACT, CONTACT, CONTACT” The ship repeated. 

Is this damn thing busted too-... My eyes dart to the radar screen once again and I see five red contacts on the screen. That isn't some random particle… 

I try to get a target lock on the closest target, which is… 500 meters away?!
Jesus Christ how did they get so-... a deep *BOOM* reverberated through the ship as a missile struck the side of the ship. “SHIELD HIT” The ship called out. I looked down at one of my MFDs to see the left side shield face had gone from 25% to 13% strength. Terrific. 

I grabbed the controls and pushed full throttle to try to get some velocity built up. The targeting computer finally resolved an ID. “CRUSADER ARES STARFIGHTER INFERNO, UNKNOWN SERIAL, UNKNOWN ID, NO AFFILIATION, NO OCCUPANT DATA”. Even better. I activated my blade controlled remote turrets, which immediately started spitting red plasma fire in the direction of whatever threat it thought it could hit. 

The other four targets resolved as well, and I pulled up their information as I spun the ship around to face them. An RSI Scorpius, a Vanguard Harbinger, an Ares Ion, and one final target which flickered away before I could read it. 

This was a fight I would not win on my own, even with my skills. Not in this ship anyways. Just as the five targets came into my view screen, the fifth, flickery one I hadn’t gotten an ID on, started glowing a blue color. No time to worry about that. I activated missile mode and began computing a targeting solution for the nearest target, the Inferno.

Just as the target lock acquired, a second loud *BOOM* hit my ship. The right side face now took a hit from a missile. From 25% to 9% integrity. Luckily my left side face had already regenerated to 20% from its hit earlier. 

Target acquired on the Inferno… Missile away. I watched as the crimson streak of a size 2 missile launched towards the Inferno. Closing… Closing… The Inferno performed a strafe maneuver faster than I thought was possible for that ship… Combined with a perfectly timed flare launch, the missile missed, flying off into oblivion. 

Back in normal mode, I lined up my front facing size 3 guns, put the Inferno in the crosshair, and squeezed the trigger. Rapid fire lasers flung off towards the Inferno, landing several hits. Its shield shimmered purple as it absorbed the laser fire.

The Inferno returned fire with its massive size 7 gatling cannon. High caliber bullets striking the front of my ship in rapid succession. I saw the orange shimmer of my shields slowing the projectiles, the energy depleted rounds then harmlessly bouncing off the armor of my ship. 

The fire continued from the Inferno as I took another missile hit to the right side of the ship. “RIGHT SHIELD DOWN” The 400i piped over the speakers. I instinctively yaw the ship to the right to cover that face, and divert power to the shields as I notice my weapons capacitor rapidly depleting, the front guns now gimballing to maintain fire on the Inferno. My targeting computer showed me the Inferno’s front shield face at 15%. 

My mind then turned to the fact that I was just combating one single ship… and four others were just hanging back and watching. Whoever these people are… They’re toying with me. Wait… Oh fuck.
