PART 3 OF 3

  

I woke up groggily in the surprisingly clean hospital in Haven. My shoulders ached like nothing I’d ever experienced before. Both of my arms were in slings, hooked up to gel lines that ran back into the hospital bed machine. They have some surprisingly fancy technology here, this is UEE hospital level stuff.

  

Noticing my wakefulness, a male doctor in a white lab coat walks over to me from the other side of the small white room. “Ah, you’re awake. Good. You suffered some pretty bad injuries in your crash, but you got your mission completed, didn’t you?” The man said through tight lips covered by a long ginger beard. His voice had a sharpness to it. Who the hell is this? Not a regular doctor it seems. In my recently-awake grogginess I didn’t have the chance to reply before he continued “Although judging by that fresh scar on your face, you didn’t have a choice but to finish the mission, did you? You’d have had much worse than a couple broken collar bones and bruising if you didn’t pay off the Nine Tails, right?” The ‘doctor’ said, a small smirk creeping into the corner of his mouth.

  

Is this guy…?

  

“Nevertheless, we have you hooked up to a steady flow of Hemozal, Roxaphen and Demexatrine, the slings are just to keep your bones placed correctly while they rapidly fuse together thanks to the Hemozal. The Demexatrine is for the concussion you suffered in the crash, and the Roxaphen is for the pain. You’ll be able to take those slings off and get out of here in just a few hours.” The doctor continued.

  

While the man took a breath I was finally able to muster up the words through my still blurry vision, “Wait… who… are… you… again?” I stutter out.

  

The man glanced up from his data pad and looked me in the eye, seeming to cling to my scarred cheek. “I am one of Borlathar’s associates. Here to ensure you got his message. Turns out that debt’s aren't much good when held by the deceased.” He said with shocking calmness

and candor. My eyes widened, and I felt my pulse elevate. Before I could respond, “He wants you to know that even though your debt is paid, you still are in debt to the Nine Tails. That scar on your face is a permanent mark of… ownership, you might say. Once you are healed you are free to leave this place, and go about your life. But if the Nine Tails need you again, you will be contacted, and you will be found, and you will serve, under penalty of death. Understood?” The man said.

Now sweating, my heart racing, my chest tightening up in panic, all I could manage was but a nod. “Good. Get well soon.” The ‘doctor’ said, a hint of feigned joy in his voice. He then expeditiously left the room.

  

Well. Shit…..Shit shit shit shit… This is just great. I risk my neck and life and limb to pay off a stupid debt and now they aren’t even considering it paid! I can’t believe it.

  

At that moment a heavy fog came over me, my eyes got unbelievably heavy, and I drifted into a medically induced sleep.

  

—-----------

Several hours later I woke up, my slings gone, and in much less pain than before. I opened my eyes and looked around the room. There were three armed men in heavy armor, standing, guarding towards the door. Seeing me wake, one of them comes to me and says “Don’t panic, we’re here to help you. We were sent by the person that worked with you on your recent mission.” The man said with a deep voice. I couldn’t see any of his facial features behind his Defiance enclosed battle helmet, but I could somehow tell he had good intentions.

  

“O-...Okay… Did you see the… Man that was in here before…?” I mutter slowly, trying to keep the spinning room from making me puke. “We caught him on cams and came here as soon as we could, but we missed him. He wasn’t us, nor part of this facility. We have a feeling we know why he was here, but it isn’t really our problem. Did he hurt you?” The guard said.

  

“No, I’m fine… He just gave me a message.” I replied. “Okay. We will get you out of here soon.”

The man told me.

  

A couple hours later I was well enough to be released from the hospital. That miraculous Hemozal shit heals you like nothing else man. My collar bones are already perfectly fused. I was told by an actual doctor there that I shouldn’t exceed 7 G’s while flying for a few days, but otherwise I should be good to go. They gave me some Resurgera to knock off the haziness from all the healing drugs. Now with a clear mind, they escorted me to my ship.

  

I arrived at the hangar, the same one I had crash landed in, as far as I could tell. Judging by the scrapes down the far wall of the hangar. My 325a, the Ready Or Not, is sitting in the middle of the hangar, in seemingly pristine condition.

A short, female figure was standing by my ship, wearing a ForceFlex undersuit and partially enclosed Oracle helmet. The undersuit was oily and covered in various fluids that presumably came from my ship.

  

The guards leaving my side, to return back through the door we entered the hangar in, gave me a brief pat on the back. I then walked over to the woman standing by my ship.

  

“I fixed your ship for you. Plus a couple small modifications as an additional thank you for getting my sister back.” She said in an ever so slightly electronically modified voice through her helmet. “Thank you…?” I said, still unsure who this was.

  

“I go by Italina. I was the person who sent the contract to you, and paid you. I’m a mechanic, and that’s all you need to know for now.” She said, I looked her over, tools magnetically clamped to her waistband, no weapons or perceptible tricks to be seen.

  

“Okay… What kind of modifications did you do to my ship? And how did you fix it so quickly?” I asked her, very suspicious of who she was or what she was really doing. The damn doctor I woke up to was a NineTails rep. Theres no reason this couldn’t be another Borlathar thrall sent to fuck up my life.

  

“They’re classified, and I’d recommend not showing them off to any UEE inspectors, but let’s just say it should keep the NineTails from tracking you quite so easily.” She said in a cool, smooth voice.

  

“Alright… I guess that means I shouldn’t ask about it any further.” I said, beginning to figure I shouldn’t look a gift horse too closely in the mouth. I have no other way off this rock, so if my ship blows up when I’m 200km from here, I guess it might be a more peaceful ending anyways.

  

She nodded in response to my statement.

I thought about the damage my ship had sustained in the crash. I’m pretty sure I tore off a wing… How did she fix all that to pristine condition so fast? Or… How long was I out?

“Hey… How did you fix all that damage so quickly?” I asked, gawking at my ship after the realization of exactly how much work that must have been.

  

“Oh I had time.” She responded slyly.

Before giving me time to reply she stepped aside, pressing the ship’s keyfob to pop the door and ladder open. She then hands me my MobiGlas and the Fob it’s programmed to. “Here you are. And your armor and gear you came here in are also stored in your ship. Keep the civvie clothes we lended to you. I don’t have any more use for them anyways.” She said.

  

I felt like there could have been a deeper meaning to that last part, but was surely not going to press it.

I began to climb up the entry ladder into my ship, and as I turned back to wish Italina a farewell and final thanks for all she did for me, I noticed she was gone. Well, that’s strange. I continued up into my ship, retracting the ladder and sealing the door. I opened up my Mobiglas and noticed a new contact saved. “REDACTED” is all it said. Well I guess I know who that must be.

  

I sat down in the pilot seat and fired up the engines. The Ready Or Not roared to life like she was brand new. I scanned my HUD and system displays, checking for anything that could be suspicious. I noticed my signature readouts were like 1/5th of what they used to be, even considering I was just sitting on the pad with the engines running.

  

Alright… So stealth mods perhaps…? Interesting.

  

I open the hangar door with my MobiGlas, and fly the Ready Or Not up and out of the hangar. I plot a course for Stanton. “Well… If the NineTails want to try to ruin my life… Maybe I can return the favor a little…” I say to myself, pushing the Ready Or Not’s throttles to half, being careful to set the G limiter to 7G’s.

  

I activate the Quantum drive, point the ship at the Tyrol>Goss jump gate, and soar off into the void beyond.
