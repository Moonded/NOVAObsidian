**PART 3**

I have two options here. I can retreat inside the ship, bar myself in somewhere, and hope that they decide to leave my floating derelict drifting in space until I can get rescued, Or I have to exit this ship and face whatever is walking on my hull, face to face. 

Figuring that the Syndicate *probably* don’t like to leave loose ends, I figure I’d probably rather have a bullet to the head than a helpless death locked in the bathroom of an exploding ship. 

I pushed myself away from the interior cargo bay door which I’d been braced to, and EVA out of the space where the cargo lift door had been violently ripped away. 
I do a quick look around, not identifying any threats. Debris is floating all around. Pieces of *my* ship. A winglet here, a turret gun there. The nose of my ship had totally separated and was spinning away from the body slowly. 

I floated around the rear of the ship, to get eyes on the top. I saw three figures standing on the roof of the ship, just above the bridge. They were wearing black armor I’ve never seen before. Gloss black metal plates, curved gracefully along with blue lines of light down the extremities. The face plate was an opaque dark blue and featured a full face visor with more blue energy lines along the bottom edge, and exquisite black and gold metal contours along the top. 

Two of the figures were wielding S-71 assault rifles, and one a salvage multitool. The middle one had begun stripping the composite from my hull, and the other two had not seemed to notice me yet. I thrusted back down behind the rear lip of the ship’s hull, opening my HUD’s menu to a diagnostic screen linked to the ship. 
It had come back online but so many systems were damaged it could hardly give me an update at all. I guess the Raven wasn't bothering to EMP anymore as the ship clearly would never move again under its own power. 
Searching through the ship’s few remaining systems for any potential play I could make… My eyes caught on the fact that the deck turret on the top rear of the ship was still… although barely… operational. One of the guns was broken off entirely, and the other’s capacitor was so damaged it could only fire 7-10 shots and then it’d probably be toast.
I linked my HUD into the turret’s remote control… synced up the camera feed, blurry and without color, and I began to turn the turret from its aft facing position, towards the three figures. I moved it as slowly as I could to try to avoid the soldiers seeing it. 

As soon as one of their heads snapped towards the turret, and myself, I then rapidly aimed the turret at the figure and fired away the remaining energy in its dying capacitor.

After hiding behind the rear lip of the ship for a few moments, waiting for the return fire to die down, I peeked my head back up and saw three bodies floating off the hull, red outlines of energy burn holes laden throughout their chests and heads. Two each, and a third one in the soldier who had noticed me first. Targets down… Good.

I scanned the space around me, seeing no signs of any ships except for that Raven, which appeared unoccupied. Which is weird… right? If they were going to strip my hull and take my stealth composites, wouldn’t they keep their ships here to load that onto?

I’m not even sure if-... I felt a poke in my spine. The jolt of pain reminding me of my cracked vertebrae. “If you want to live… don’t fucking move.” A deep voice vibrated through my helmet, coming through my helmet comms. “You had something that belonged to us. That was mistake one.” The voice continued. “Mistake two was trying to take it to the authorities.” He said. I realized the poke in my back was the tip of a knife, pressing against my undersuit. “Mistake three is not immediately running away, thinking you stood a chance.” He said, his voice lowering into a menacing whisper. 

“Now, I suppose we’ll see if your little NOVA crew can track a phantom distress call from your glorified smuggling ship drifting and broken a million klicks from the nearest person who gives a shit.” He spun me around, the dark blue opaque faceplate glaring at me. I could see the red eyes from my Oracle helmet reflecting off his expressionless visor. 

“Next time don’t steal from the Syndicate.” He said, stabbing his knife into the power pack at the back of my armor. My HUD flashed red for a split second and then disappeared. He kicked me hard in the stomach, sending me tumbling away from my wrecked ship. 

The air in my helmet became stale slowly, as I watched the stars spin as I flipped head over heels into the void. My vision slowly went colorless, and faded into nothing.
