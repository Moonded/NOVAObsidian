MISSION CLOCK: 4D 17H 38M
N-ID: 615997 - PILOT/ HEATHENS
CALLSIGN: CEPHEUS
NAME: ERR
SYSTEM: STANTON
SHIP: NSS POINT OF NO RETURN
LOCATION: ABERDEEN

  

The wind noise around the cockpit grew louder as I approached the Klesher Rehabilitation Facility. The hull of the Point Of No Return groaned from the strain of the burnt orange atmosphere. “NSS Point Of No Return, you are cleared for visual approach to pad zero niner.” The voice crackled over my radio speakers. Klesher ATC is always no nonsense. “Visual to pad zero niner.” I replied. No fluff here, unlike somewhere like microtech where you can add a “good afternoon!” To your radio transmissions.  

I hit the retro thrusters and started slowing down. The pad lit up, and I rolled the ship to face it.
“No Return, Pad 09, cleared to land.”
“09, clear to land”. Standard as standard can be… I always liked to add personality to my radios. But these guys see that as suspicious.  

I gently sat the luxury ship down on the pad, got up from the seat, and took the elevator down to the technical deck. I pulled my pistol off my leg holster and put it in one of the weapon racks. No guns allowed in here, unless you’re a guard of course. Armor is fine though. The guards aren't oblivious to the amount of shivs in circulation in this place. My FDL-8 armor, while not as protective as the heavy stuff Commander Nazsvegnyama has designated as the Heathens uniform, I find it a lot more comfortable to wear on the daily. Outside of squad operations at least. Either way, it should stop a shiv. Not that I expect to need that… today.  

I deployed the front ramp of the 400i, watching the floorboards retreat with classic Origin grace, opening the main exit to the ship.
I walked down the ramp stairs and was promptly greeted by two heavily armed prison guards.
“State your business!” The one on the left barked at me.

“I'm here on behalf of NOVA Defense. You should have a request on file to visit with Samuel Haggard.” I replied, as official sounding as I could muster. I’ve never been on the other side of this prison. Thank God. But I’ve known many who were. Rough place, putting it lightly. A primal fear always emerges from deep within me whenever I come here.  

“Proceed.” The guard says, after subtly checking my credentials on his helmet HUD. They turned around and led me through a security scanner and then a couple long hallways to a visiting room. Black and yellow painted titanium walls, visitation booths with glass stronger than that which covers starship cockpits, and many… many armed guards. I hate this place. I'm here on legal business and the way these guards look at you makes me feel like I'm still a criminal.  

One guard walks up to me, “You here for Haggard? …. Bay six.” He says, gesturing to the bay to the far right of the back wall.  

My official mission here is to interrogate a known pirate lord whose buddies are currently terrorizing the ArcCorp area. I'm to get as much information as possible on their full capabilities, base locations, and amount of personnel and equipment. Then once I get said info, NOVA plans to send a small strike team to hit them at their home. Should reduce the crime rate in ArcCorp by a good few percent.  

Although… with this recent news about the Orphanage… I wonder if Haggard knows anything about it… might be able to kill two birds with one stone. Or at least kill one bird and get some intel on another. He’s definitely in circles closer to the Orphanage than my contact I called a few days ago.  

I sat down on the uncomfortable metal stool in the visitation bay. Waited a few minutes… and eventually, who must have been none other than Samuel Haggard showed up. 6’9 and 400lbs easy, this guy sure looks like a pirate lord.  

He sits down with a heavy thud, Puts his hands on the desk, and snarls at me, “What the hell do you want?!”
