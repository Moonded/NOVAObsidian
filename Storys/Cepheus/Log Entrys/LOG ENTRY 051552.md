Well. We got him. I learned a lot during that op. Here’s how it all went down.

  

I had, per Archangel’s suggestion,I traded my S71 rifle for an A03 Sniper rifle with a 4x scope on it, for use as a DMR. A new combination to me, but I decided it’d be worth a good try.

  

I was riding along in the second of two Vanguard Hoplite’s that Archangel was using for this operation. I had been given command of the team on my Hoplite. This isn't my first time leading a squad on the ground but damn it always keeps my stomach in knots.

  

Archangel informed me via comms that his snipers were greenlit to take down all exterior guards of the Kudre Ore Mine, our target. With that, the hum of the Hoplite’s engines turned into a deep roar as the pilot kicked on the afterburners. Strapped in my seat, thankfully, my helmet’s G sensors peaked at 8G’s. That’s pretty stiff, but I figure they wanted to come in quick in case there was some Anti-air protecting the facility.

  

This did not appear to be the case and we landed uneventfully. The ship set down on the sand with a rough THUNK. Not quite as elegant as if I was flying, but hey, Command destined me for a more…direct role in this op due to my prior involvement and somewhat more direct dealings with Malachite, which they feel gives me an advantage in ground engagements. Sure.

  

The rear door and ramp of the hoplite hissed open as the ship's atmosphere vented, filling the hold with Daymar’s Nitrogen and Methane atmosphere. My helmet’s external vents slammed shut, and the metallic taste of filtered air chilled my teeth for a moment as my body adjusted.

  

The restraints on my seat released and I got up behind another soldier, as we had discussed on the flight, I really didn’t want to be on point.

I exited the ship, the harsh Stanton sun washing out my vision for the briefest of moments while my helmet’s cameras compensated.

We approached the mouth of the cave, noting the duo of armored bodies lying nearby. I scanned them with my visor, reading no life signs from either.

I grabbed my A03 rifle and flipped off the safety as we entered the cave. As we got deeper into the cave the sun’s harsh light faded to darkness. I switched my helmet to night vision mode and continued on, close on the six of the soldier in front of me.

  

As we descended further, the cave opened up into a wider room and Archangel directed my team to stay to the left of the cave while he and his team hugged the right wall.

  

We did so, and just moments later we overheard a voice talking on his radio, saying something about hearing noise outside. We took this as our cue to attack and quickly took down the singular soldier.

As we had pushed deeper into the mine, suddenly the head of the soldier in front of me exploded into a pink mist and then my vision suddenly went black. No warnings, no alarms, nothing. Just pure blackness. I then felt a series of THUDs on my head and torso. I assumed those were bullets striking me but I felt no pain. The force knocked me on my back, and I laid down, hoping I could play dead long enough for Arch to finish them off.

Hearing muffled gunshots all around me, and no vision whatsoever, I waited anxiously for the gunfight to be over.

  

It took what felt like an eternity but eventually the gunfire stopped, and I could feel footsteps around me. Hearing a muffled “Ceph!” from what sounded like Archangel’s voice, I was rolled from stomach down to being on my back, and hands grabbed my head.

  

After a couple moments of rustling and being shifted around by whoever was knelt down beside me, I heard some pops and clicks, seemingly someone opening access compartments. Then my vision returned, blurry and distorted with black zones in several places. Slowly those resolved into clear vision again and my HUD slowly came online.

I saw Archangel and his squad mates standing over me, Arch himself knelt down, looking concerned but also a bit smug.

“I told you, you gotta fix that breathing noise Ceph!” He said, with a slight chuckle.

I gotta say while that frustrated me quite a bit at the time, looking back I appreciate it.

  

“Gaah, what the hell was that?!” I said, aware my voice was distorted and electronic sounding to those around me. “Malachite seemed to have rigged an EMP. Maybe looking to catch specifically you off guard, hard to say.” Arch replied.

  

And I thought that wasn’t possible… Damn.

  

Most of my armor’s systems and HUD now online, I was able to read my suit’s status, as mostly green. Some bullet damage to my helmet and chest but luckily it held. All major systems are green.

  

I picked up my A03 rifle which had fallen beside me and looked to Arch, “Alright, what next?”.

“Next we get you up and get our new friend Malachite out of this damn cave.” Arch said, grabbing my arm and helping me to my feet.

  

I was able to look past and spot Malachite, seemingly wounded but alive, and in restraints held by a good group of NOVA Marines. The Ghosts, I recognized them as.

Just before we could start heading out of the cave, the overwatch at the surface reported two Cutlass Blacks had come in through the valley and destroyed our CAS, and landed at the entrance of the cave, deploying around a dozen hostiles.

  

“Alright, round 2! Everyone ready?” Arch said. A round of “Yes sir!” went off across the room and we took up defensive positions. I laid behind some rocks and awaited the arrival of this new wave of foes.

They came in through the same funnel entrance we had been forced through, and finally given the chance to pop off some rounds, I struck and downed 3 soldiers. A fourth one which had only been wounded from my A03 popped back up and released a volley of rounds from his FS9, striking me in the chest several times. I felt a sharp pain in my left lung and alarms started blaring in my helmet.

  

Just managing to line him up, I fired my weapon and killed the attacker. My vision started to go gray, I sat down and rapidly fumbled my medical gun off my left thigh and held it to my arm, pulling the trigger. The cold rush of the automatically adjusted medical cocktail perked me right up, and the alarms in my helmet silenced. I was left with a self-sealing breach in my chest armor, and a tier 3 chest wound. But thanks to the med gun I wasn't feeling too bad.

  

Archangel and his team dispatched the rest of the attackers pretty quickly and with no further casualties and, with some assistance from one of Arch’s team mates, I exfiled from the cave, boarding one of the two Drake Cutlass Black’s that the hostiles had landed.

  

The pilot of the commandeered Cutlass took me to the NSS Emelia and I was helped along to the med bed within. After a brief diagnosis the med bed worked its magic, repairing what turned out to be a punctured lung. After a short recovery I exited the medical suite on the Carrack and met ArchangelCorps in his Captain’s Quarters where I am now, recording this log…

  

That’s all you need to hear, mystical NOVA Intel staff… The rest I’ll save for my own personal logs.
