After about a day in the hospital, recovering from my last mission gone wrong,I walked my way through the temperate climate of Crusader towards the Greencircle Habs building at Orison.

  

I’m aware that NOVA has it’s Stanton HQ at ArcCorp, but I’ve always liked Crusader. Much better views and cleaner air. Plus I don't mind the travel for whenever we have operations underway. I rent an apartment in the Greencircle habs in Orison. Very nice place, at a high price of course. Thankfully due to my work at NOVA, I can afford it.

  

After a few days of R&R at home, I went to the August Dunlow spaceport, and retrieved the NSS Point Of No Return from the hangars. NOVA Rescue had been very kind to store my ship there after my mishap.

  

I boarded the beautiful black and orange 400i, closed the ramp and took the lift up to the habitation deck. I took a moment to check all my things were properly stowed, and present in the Captain’s Quarters, and then strolled my way to the cockpit.

  

I sat down in the pilot’s seat, flipped the master power switch and watched all the screens come to life in that classic Origin style. I ran a quick diagnostic and system check to make sure nothing had broken, or been tampered with by my last adversary. Main thruster 2’s hydrogen induction manifold is running a slightly lower pressure than normal, but that’s probably just wear. I do run these babies pretty hard. I made a note to get that checked at the next maintenance visit, and finished the diagnostic with green across the board.

  

Satisfied with the condition of my ship, I called Orison ATC for a departure release, and slowly throttled up the engines as the hangar door hissed open.

Once the door was sufficiently open, I throttled forward and rushed out the hangar, pitching up 80 degrees and speeding towards the sky. Once I passed 150km in altitude, I spooled up the QT drive, checking the parameters closely as it hummed to life. Port Olisar would be my first stop. I need to restock on ammo for my guns before I head to my next destination; ArcCorp.

I could just get ammo there, sure, but I like supporting the shops on Olisar. Nice folk, there.

  

A quick QT boosted zoom over to Port Olisar, and I called Olisar ATC as I approached the starport. They cleared me to land and I set the ship down gently. I shut down the engines, but left the main power on. I won't be long here, no sense cycling the shields just to leave in 10 minutes.

  

I got up from the pilot seat and walked over to the captain's quarters. I grabbed a Stoneskin undersuit from my dresser, zipped it on, and put on the matching helmet. It sealed with a satisfying hiss and the HUD confirmed the seal was good.

  

Heading down the elevator to the Tech Deck, and then down the main ramp, I waltzed into Olisar like I owned the damn place. Headed up to Garrity Defense to buy some heavier armor. I learned my lesson last time... I purchased a nice Artimex suit, had them put it on my ship, and then went to Live Fire weapons to restock the ammo. A few S38 mags, some S71 ammo, and a case of P6LR magazines should cover me for a while. On foot combat isn't my favorite; I tend to prefer the safety of a shield generator covering my ass. But we don't always get what we want, so I prepare.

  

With all that done and loaded onto my ship, I returned to the Point Of No Return, and departed for ArcCorp.

While en route to ArcCorp, my MobiGlas pinged with an updated briefing from NOVA command about how they want me to proceed on my mission.

  

“Cepheus, we want you to head to Area 18, and meet a fellow NOVA member, callsign ArchangelCorps. He had some dealings with Malachite way back when, and we think he will be invaluable to the investigation into Malachite and the Orphanage. Land at A18 and await Archangel’s arrival. He is on leave for the next few days, so enjoy some R&R around HQ until he arrives..... NOVA out.”

  

Now if there’s an order I will never complain about following... It’s mandatory rest and relaxation. Might even have a chance to get that hydrogen manifold checked out by NOVA maintenance.

  

Not long after, the Point Of No Return’s QT drive made my favorite sound ever, the one that means the QT jump is coming to an end.

I closed my MobiGlas and looked out the windshield to see ArcCorp’s blue corporate beauty fast approaching through the Cherenkov radiation of quantum travel.

The 400i popped out of QT in low ArcCorp orbit, and I maneuvered the ship to enter the atmosphere manually. I pointed towards Area 18’s landing zone, and throttled to maximum.

  

The gorgeous orange plasma of reentry slowly enveloped the ship as I descended into the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds
