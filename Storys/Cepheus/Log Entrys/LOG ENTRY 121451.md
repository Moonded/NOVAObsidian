It’s been a month since my last entry.... Yeah I’ve been busy. Haggard back at Klesher was a partial wash. Dude had not much more to help me with than throwing spit at the glass that sat between us. With that said, I did manage to pry some small nuggets of information out of him. That ended up being enough to deduce the locations of two of the pirate outfit’s bases. After that I went and scouted said locations, got some solid intel, and sent it to the NOVA Defense command, who, I assume, promptly shut them down. I never found out for sure because I was promptly put on another mission.

  

The International Aerospace Expo, or IAE, had taken place shortly thereafter. I attended of course... Lots to see at an event like that, and Microtech is always nice this time of year. Some new ships were unveiled and I got some ideas for the next upgrade in my fleet.

  

After a day or two at IAE, it was back to business. Several small missions came and went. Nothing really to note. Just yesterday though I got a new request from the UEE, via NOVA Defense. It was about a guy who went by Hal over in the Crusader system. Word is he likes to hide away on one of the floating freight platforms by Orison where he sells... ‘modified’ QT drives. These drives are supposedly much faster than commercially available ones. That said they also have a tendency to explode after so much usage. Not that his customers know this. He is also unlicensed, so that's probably where the UEE sanction comes from. Seems they care more about the license than the explosions. Typical.

I headed to Hal’s platform at Orison under the guise of a customer. Just as we were finishing up his paperwork, which attempted to be subtle about the fact that he was making you waive all ability to let your family sue him after your ship's destruction... I made the arrest. It went smoother than most of my operations, that's for sure. Or that's what I thought.

  

As we neared the staircase of The Point Of No Return, he was desperately trying to give up information, offer money, really anything that would let him keep his freedom. I didn't care for any of that, seeing as how his ‘modified’ QT drives were responsible for at least 50 deaths across the Stanton system.

  

That was until he mentioned the Orphanage... I had... ashamedly... almost forgotten about that place. Too heavy to bear perhaps. He must have spotted me as a member of NOVA. I mean our memberships aren't exactly a secret. Hal said he had a contact there, could give me information that could lead to an arrest on the persons responsible for the place. In exchange for letting him go.... Of course that wasn't going to happen. But I played along.

“The director of the place is a guy who goes by Malachite. He lives in Arccorp. High level apartments, nicely removed from his dirty work. If you can get a hold of him, you can very likely figure out how to shut the place down.” Hal said to me, a sense of calm creeping into his voice.

“If you let me go, I will send you the coordinates to his place...” he continued. Now I wasn't exactly planning on letting him get his way... So I had to figure out how to get both the information, and his ass in The Point Of No Return’s brig. “Okay... I'll let you go. But coords first.” I told him, slightly relaxing my grip on his arm as we stood just below the stairway to my 400i.

  

He gave me a very suspicious look and said “No. You let me go first. I can't use my MobiGlas anyways with my hands cuffed. I promise I will stop selling the drives.” Pfft. This guy. I turned him around and undid the cuffs, knowing the second he sent that data I was going to tackle him and cuff him right back up. “T-thank you!” he said to me, quickly opening his MobiGlas and tapping it a bunch of times. I felt my own mobi buzz and I opened it up. There they were, the coordinates. If they were indeed the real coordinates, I couldn't be sure, of course. Hell, I couldn't even be sure that Malachite was a real person that existed, or if Hal was just bullshitting me because he knew that NOVA was looking to take down the Orphanage.

  

What I didn't see as I was looking over these coordinates,was Hal had drawn a snub pistol he had creatively concealed somewhere. He had just gotten it to bear on me when I saw him behind my mobi’s display. “HEY, WAI-” I yelled as he pulled the trigger. I had blacked out for a moment... Waking up on the ground some time later. I could hardly breathe. Hal was gone....The bullet was a small caliber, but it still managed to penetrate my chest armor and clip a lung,judging by my inability to breathe properly. Serves me right I guess for only wearing light armor on... direct contact operations. The suit had self sealed and stopped the bleeding, but it didn't reinflate my lung.

I suddenly felt light headed...

I guess he didn't shoot me just once...

I woke up again and day had turned to night in the clouds of Crusader.

This time I had several alarms blaring through my armor's speakers. “WARNING, LOW BLOOD PRESSURE... WARNING, BLOOD LOSS DETECTED...” I opened the diagnostic menu in my contact lens HUD. Apparently he hit me in the stomach also. The external wound was sealed by the suit, but I had been bleeding internally this whole time. This was bad.

  

I sent out a distress signal to NOVA Rescue, and I crawled slowly up the stairs into my ship and laid down inside. Quick trip to Orison’s hospital and I’ll be right as rain... Just need.... A ride...

Distress call was sent... and shortly after I passed out again. Apparently NOVA Rescue does their job as advertised. No surprise there, because I woke up in a hospital bed in Orison General.

I’m writing this from said bed. This place is pretty neat. I'm hardly in any pain, and the doc’s say I should be discharged within a day or so.

  

I enclosed the coordinates and any pertinent information to ‘Malachite’ and The Orphanage to Admiral Dolbi, sent them away, and laid back down to continue my well deserved bed rest.
