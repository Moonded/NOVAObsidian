Cepheus: Hey ShaRroos. Remember me? I had you work on the Point Of No Return a while ago.

ShaRroos: Ah yes, Hello Ceph! I heard about your ship… Tragedy, that one. What can I do for you?

Cepheus: Well that’s just it. I need a new one… I’m a bit tight on funds due to the loss of the Return, but I need a replacement. I’m thinking an MSR. 

ShaRroos: Hmm… Let me get back to you…

I reclined in my chair in the guest crew quarter station in the cargo bay aboard the NSS Emelia. Archangel has been very gracious to give me a place to stay here, while keeping in the TF:A loop while things cool down. Hasn’t stopped me from coordinating getting myself back up to full strength, as much as I’m sure NOVA would prefer me *not* buy a new stealth ship before they’ve even finished investigating the first one. 

I’d been working on improving my gear while I’ve been staying on the Emelia. Got the hardware and software improvements done to my armor, as Archangel let me use the Carrack’s machine shop. I also spent some time working with that ship scanner that Italina gave Archangel. I figured out how to integrate it into the Carrack’s firmware and link it to the scanning room. It should give decent detection of any stealth ship in the AO around the Carrack, and provide datalink interfaces to any ships on the same network as said Carrack.



My new MobiGlas pinged with a message from ShaRroos.

ShaRroos: Sooooo, I may have a line on an MSR for you. A very wealthy client of mine had purchased an MSR a few months back… Top of the line… all the options… And he never came to pick it up from its annual inspection. I called him just now, and he asked me *’which’* MSR I was talking about… Can you believe it?!
Anyhow I…reminded him… and he said to just sell it off. I asked his price, and he hung up. Do with that what you will…
Cepheus: Interesting… Thanks… How much do you want?

ShaRroos: Well… It’s been racking up hangar fees while it’s been in storage. Pay those off, and the bill for its inspection, and it’s yours.

Cepheus: Done…Can you do some work on it… too?

ShaRroos: That depends on what you want.

Cepheus: I need some engine and shield tuning done, as well as upgrades to the countermeasures. Plus possibly installing AI blades and refitting the manned turrets to be AI controlled.

ShaRroos: Nothing there seems impossible. I am guessing that you would like to tune it for ‘Helios' salvage? A lot of those modifications are rather expensive

Cepheus: Just some standard performance tuning… Plus some stealth tuning… Helios salvage will work… But I’m not trying to hide this from NOVA. So at least… semi… above board. For expense… It’s why I wanted a low-cost ship option.

ShaRroos: I see… 

Cepheus: I also want to see about replacing the server room with a workshop, with a fabricator, analysis suite, and repair table. 

ShaRroos: Let me do some research, and I’ll get you a quote.

Cepheus: Thanks. Till’ next time.

Well that will be good if it works out… I need a ship. The Point Of No Return served me well but I need to shift my thinking… as the Return’s destruction, and then Pyro showed me… I had some shortcomings built in my way of operating.
