**BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP**
I’m jolted from a deep sleep, vision blurry as I force my eyes open. The ceiling of the bedroom is illuminated in a combination of a deep orange and pink Crusader sunrise, and the ambient purple lighting of the apartment. 

I turn my head to the right, spotting the ringing alarm clock through my hazy vision, and slap the top of the screeching device with a metallic *clank* as my metal hand hits the snooze button. 
With the noise quieted, I turn my head to my left. Cassie is sleeping soundly next to me, unbothered by the alarm. Turning back to the clock, I decide to read it this time. 0530. 
Damn I hate getting up this early, but I have work to do today. 

Archangel… Sorry, *Admiral* Archangel just promoted me to Wing Commander last night. I still can’t believe it. Thats a *lot* of responsibility, really fast too. But I guess the situation with the Syndicate demands it. I suppose my performance as of recent has been enough of an indicator to Command that they want to use me for ‘greater things’. 

I throw the covers off of myself, and get out of the bed quietly, to not disturb Cass. Standing up and stretching, I then make sure to fully turn off the clock’s alarm. I walk with muffled steps across the carpeted floor, over to the closet, putting on my Sabine undersuit, freshly cleaned. 

Not even 0545 and I’m suiting up? No rest for the wicked I suppose. Or wing commanders. Is there a difference? 

Circling back around to my bedside table, I secure my MobiGlas to my wrist, kiss Cass on the head, and then exit the bedroom. I turn right down the hall to the bathroom. I step to the mirror and grab my Mobi contact lenses case off the counter. I insert them into my eyes and their HUD boots to life in my field of view. Connection with the undersuit is good… Vitals good. I tap the top of my cybernetic right hand with my left, triggering a HUD widget to pop up in my vision. Cybernetic status green. Charged via induction as I slept, and synced fully to my nervous system now. In the seven or so months I’ve had it, I’ve been able to afford some upgrades, the likes of which I’ll have to save for later. Satisfied, I turn the HUD down to “Minimal” mode and exit the bathroom towards the kitchen,where I flick on the lights and move towards the coffee machine. 

Placing a mug under the coffee maker, I tap its buttons in the sequence to commence the brewing of my favorite dirty bean water, and then open my MobiGlas’ holo display.
*Sixty Seven* notifications, God Damn! They weren’t kidding that Wing Co’s have their work cut out for them. I flip through the pings and sort out the noise.
Coffee still brewing, A Classified Tier 1 alert flashes red on the top of my Mobi Display and my contact lens HUD. Not a second later, I am bombarded by a ringtone. A phone call? At 0533?

“INCOMING CALL: ADMIRAL ARCHANGELCORPS” scrolls across both my displays simultaneously. An annoying ‘high priority’ feature.  I accept the call and Archangels’ weathered face fills my Mobi’s holo display. Before he speaks I ensure the volume is reduced sufficiently to not disturb Cass in the bedroom.

“Wing Commander Cepheus. Good Morning.” He says. I can tell from his tone of voice and formal verbiage he is not bearing good news. “Good morning yourself, Arch. I just saw the alert but didn’t have time to read it before you called. What’s going on?” I reply, my coffee finishing it’s brew with a *ding* just behind my Mobi’s display. 

“Sorry to disturb you before you’ve had your coffee, it seems. But there’s been an incident.” He says. 
I can’t exactly say my heart dropped. There’s more possibilities to this ‘incident’ than I could count. Has another admiral been kidnapped? Has one of my wing members been killed or lost? Has Italina professed her love for Archangel yet? 

I raise my eyebrows for the camera, indicating for Arch to go on.
“I got a report a few hours ago that an Anvil Arrow combat air patrol pilot was engaged in a dogfight and killed by a Syndicate Aegis Sabre Raven during one of his routine patrols outside of one of our Microtech surface bases.”
Now my heart dropped. The Syndicate? Engaging us in open combat? That’s new. 

“Did he regenerate?” I asked, fearing the answer.
“His body did in the hospital at the base, but it was lifeless. Almost as if his Ibrahim sphere had lost connection with his consciousness. He’s gone.” Arch responded somberly. 
“God damn. A fluke with the Sphere or do you think the Syndicate has regen jamming tech? I know that’s been theorized.” 
“Hard to tell at this point. The eggheads in R&D are working on it. For now though, this is a declaration of war.” Archangel said with a finality I’ve not heard in his voice before.

“Weren’t we already at war?” I ask.
“A clandestine one, to a degree. The larger part of NOVA wasn’t on alert for them, but whispers of course had propagated. The Syndicate isn’t a ‘secret’, but we didn’t want to raise an alert for a reclusive smuggling organization. Now though, that they’re striking us in open, NOVA controlled skies, things have changed.”
“So what’s next? We don’t know anything new about them, do we? We’ve been hunting down their bases as we can find them, but as far as any nerve centers go, we’re coming up empty every time.” I inquire.
I flicked my metal pointer finger at the large display on the wall across the kitchen from me. The video call display seamlessly jumped from my Mobi screen to the display, freeing up my hands to finish making my coffee.
“No, we haven't learned anything new. I also don’t expect High Command is going to ask us to go on a full scale war with them. We’ll exhaust ourselves and the Syndicate will just go into hiding. We need to play smart here.”
“Okay… So what is my tasking?”
“Take that fancy stealth ‘Runner of yours and go to some coordinates I’m forwarding to you. All that fancy tech you have makes for a pretty decent scout, right?”
“Okay… should I mobilize the wing?”
“No, I want you alone on this one. You have, allegedly, the stealthiest ship this side of the AF Stealth Recon division, and they’re currently tasked out in Pyro on some op that’s out of my jurisdiction. I don’t want the Syndicate to be tipped off to our reaction. They’ll be expecting us to launch a major offensive. I plan to pull together a show for them, but you’re my real course of action here.”
“Got it, sir.” I replied. I pour a little sugar and some cream into my coffee, stirring it with the spoon accompanying the mug, and then take a sip.
The small secondary display next to the main one on the kitchen wall flashed to life, displaying the Coordinates that Archangel had sent.
They pointed to a cave on Aberdeen. 

Archangel snickered subtly on the video call. 
“What?!” I ask lightheartedly. “You *would* take your coffee with cream, sugar, and all the other prissy stuff, huh?” Amused at the playful jab, I fired back “And I thought you’d never strap a desk to your ass, but I guess we’re all full of surprises huh?”. Archangel laughed.
“Coordinates received. Aberdeen? What are you expecting to find there?” I ask once the laughing subsides.

“I have heard from one of my sources that the Syndicate uses that cave as a staging area for their weapons stockpiles. It’s not the stockpile itself, but it’s where their runners drop the goods for Syndicate operatives to pick up later. It could be a nice place to get a lucky tracker stuck to one of their ships.” Archangel detailed.
“Expected resistance?” I ask.
“Little to none, so long as the Syndicate isn’t currently there.” He replied.
“You’re to scout the area, locate hiding spots for a Ranger scout to camp out for as long as necessary, take LIDAR imagery of the area, and return, *undetected*.” He continued, emphasizing the ‘undetected’ part. 

“Got it, sir. Give me 4 hours.” I reply, popping a semi-sharp salute. A mixture of jest to a friend, and respect to an Admiral. 
“I want a report of your findings in no more than 6 hours” Archangel responds.

“Enjoy your weenie coffee.” He adds jestfully, the video call closing immediately thereafter.

I roll my eyes and sigh to the blank display, taking another swig of my coffee. Fine terran coffee beans. Little cream and sugar to cut the bitterness and bring out the rich flavor. Archangel doesn’t know what he’s missing!

Still casting my Mobi display to the kitchen display screen, I gesture with my cybernetic, linked to the wearable computer, to plug in the coordinates into my map and plot a course.
Performance data, fuel burn, environmental data, traffic data, and other information populated the screen. 

With a metallic snap of my fingers, assisted by my cybernetic neural link, the flight plan was filed with Orison ATC, a fuel request sent to the hangar attendants, the *NSS From The Ashes* performed a self-diagnostic pre-flight in its hangar, coming back green, and my Artimex suit booted up out of view in the apartment’s armory.

No rest for the wicked. Time to get to work.
