BEGIN PART 2

The beautiful blue lights of the warp gate surrounded the Ready Or Not like I was flying at hypersonic speeds through a tunnel.

I sit in the pilot seat, gripping the yoke as I prepare for the ship to exit on the Tyrol side of the Goss>Tyrol jump gate.

The ship shudders and groans as I see the bright, dying red subgiant star peek through the end of the tunnel.

  

With a sharp JOLT the 325a exited the jump gate and was now in real space. I double checked all the ship’s systems and when they were confirmed to be all showing green, I set the course to Haven and plugged in the landing pad I was told to arrive at.

The ship entered quantum travel with that signature FWOOP I had come to love; although this time it wasn’t quite so satisfying, as I knew this might be one of the last times I’d ever hear it.

  

I landed at Haven, Zone 12, Pad 1, just as instructed. The landing zone was uncontrolled by any ATC so I just requested landing at the pad manually through my ship’s comms. I noted on my approach that my ship’s skin temperature was approaching the yellow ‘caution’ threshold. Setting down, the place was quiet, almost too quiet. With rust climbing the walls of the hangar, and random cables strewn about. This place wasn't maintained with the highest regard, as I’d expect in a home for the homeless.

  

I shut down my ship’s engines, being sure to leave the main systems powered on, shields running and such. Just in case, you know. I donned my DustUp armor, and linked my P4AR and S-38 to my helmet’s HUD, and clicked them to the magnetic holsters.

I then opened the external door, extended the ladder and then climbed down it. Once I was off, I tapped my MobiGlas and watched as the ladder slid inside the ship and the door sealed behind it. I double tapped the Mobi and heard the deadbolt locks click shut in the door. Nobody is getting in there but me.

  

I made my way to room 24B, which was empty initially. Eventually a man, about my height, somewhere around 6ft, walked in wearing a full suit of what appeared to be a subtly modified Artimex armor set. Those are quite exclusive and hard to get. On his back was a FS9 LMG and a railgun. This guy is serious…

  

He says “Are you Cepheus?” In a low, electronically modulated voice. “Yeah. You my guy?” I replied. The contract had briefed me to expect to meet a heavily armed individual to take with me on the mission. “Yes. Here is the plan.” The Merc started. He opened up his MobiGlas in projector mode, and displayed on the wall a map, which showed Tyrol 1A, Lanisto, he zoomed in on a zone marked “HELIX LABS”. “The target is an underground lab at this location. We will land at this landing pad, enter into the base through a door there, and shoot anything that moves and wears armor. Our objective is to rescue a girl, late teens, who was kidnapped by the operatives in the base.” The Merc explained, the Mobi now showing a diagram of the base.

  

“You will use this, plus your other weapons.” he says as he hands me a railgun. The heft of the weapon as it was thrust in my hands nearly knocked me over. “Uhh, alright.” I groan as I latch it onto my armor’s back magnetic mount, next to my P4.

“Good. Let's go.” The merc says, not wasting any time. We head back to the Ready or Not and board it, I instruct the merc to sit on my bed and strap in, as it’s the only passenger seat available in the ship.

  

We flew out to Lanisto and I set down on the landing pad that the Merc had identified.

We disembarked my 325a and readied our weapons, knowing our arrival may not have been unnoticed. Luckily Lanisto’s proximity to the dying giant star may provide some cover, I wasn’t willing to count on that.

Having noted a growing unease deep in the pit of my stomach over the electronic sounding breathing coming from the Merc’s Artimex helmet, I mention to him “Hey, I’ll cover the rear, to make sure nobody ambushes us.” “Fine.” He replies.

  

We reach the first door into the facility, and upon opening the surprisingly unlocked front door, the Merc rushes in, almost faster than I can keep up. Bang, Bang, Bang. The Merc’s FS-9 rattles off shots in semi-automatic mode, dropping bodies left and right. I turn around to watch, taken aback by the efficiency of this guy. “You are guarding the rear, no?” He barks. “Ah, yeah, sorry.” I reply, turning my attention back behind us. Just

in time too as I notice an armed and armored guard entering through the same door we entered in. I aim my P4 and squeeze the trigger, sending hot lead into the guard's torso. He drops, and we continue deeper into the facility. I notice at least 6 bodies in the room as we exit it.

  

The Merc seems to know this place really well, as he is navigating flawlessly, going from room to room, making turns without any hesitation, and finally we arrive at a locked door. “Give me that.” The Merc yells, ripping the Railgun off my armor’s back mag mount. I nearly fell backwards with the unexpected yank.

  

He readies the weapon on his shoulder and aims it at the door, charging it.

“Hey couldn't we use a-” I begin to say, interrupted by a deafening WHAM as the railgun fired. A 10 centimeter hole is now in the door where the locking mechanism used to be. The merc pulls the door open, and I turn around to look inside. A humanoid figure in a white lab coat is laying on the floor in the middle of the room, a large spray of red and pink on the back wall behind it. I look a little closer at the figure and notice it’s missing a head. Did he just…? I don’t have time to think as the Merc rushes into the room, firing shots at the other occupants of the room, some scientists, some guards. He doesn't seem to be taking the time to determine who is armed and who isn't. A fair assumption, I guess.

  

After about 8 more people are dropped in this room, the place suddenly gets very quiet. I guess everyone here is now either dead or in hiding.

The Merc walks over to a terminal and pulls a tablet out of one of his armor’s pockets, plugging it in. He taps the screen a few times and then heads over to one of the doors in the room. He sets down the railgun next to the door and then kneels down and starts messing with the wires behind the door’s control panel.

  

After a couple very anxious minutes, with me watching all the room’s entrances like a hawk, I hear the door hiss open. I turn around and the Merc and I gaze into the room, seeing a late teenage girl hooked up to a myriad of medical devices. She appeared to be unconscious. The Merc walks up to the girl without hesitation and begins to unhook her. After doing so, he picks her up, and looks at me. “You have the front now. We must hurry back to your ship.”

  

With a sharp nod I take point and lead us back out the way we came. I don’t know how I remembered our route so well, maybe it was that I walked through it backwards the first time.

We reached the ship without incident and boarded it. I get aboard first, and then grab the girl as the Merc hands her up to me. He then boarded immediately after and they got secured on the rear bed of my 325a.

  

I stow my equipment and sit in the pilot seat, firing up the engines and commanding the hangar doors to open. As soon as they are open enough for us to fit through them, I command the Ready Or Not’s thrusters to fire at full capacity, launching us out of the hangar, pointing straight into space.

  

That was when my least favorite sound blasted into my ears. A missile warning! Before I knew what had happened, a singular missile was blasting right towards my ship. I didn’t even have time to deploy countermeasures before it hit, sending my ship spinning. All the interior lights shifted to red, my status MFD now showed most parts on the rear half of the ship as red, and most of the annunciator lights on my dashboard lit up as well.

  

The G forces of the spin were pulling the Merc and girl against their restraints as I fought to regain control of my ship. I slowly wrestled the ship to a level attitude as I try to assess the situation.

MAIN ENGINE FAILURE

SHIELD GENERATOR FAILURE

COOLANT PRESSURE LOW

ENGINE OIL PRESSURE LOW

MAIN ENGINE TEMPERATURE HIGH

IFCS FAILURE

The dizzying cycle of warnings and caution messages flashing across my HUD were suddenly interrupted by a single callout from my ship’s radar, which was one of the few things still functioning. “CONTACT”.

A single red contact marker appeared off my 3 o clock, level with me, and converging quickly. Distance read 1.5km. That’s unbelievably close to have just now been detected! This ship has a custom targeting system…

  

I look out my window, seeing a faint black outline, blotting out a couple stars in the distance. The radar on my ship now showed 300 meters distance. Before I could identify the ship or any of its markings, it rolled over and blasted away into quantum travel, gone forever.

  

Now left with a crippled ship, I sat and thought for a moment to assess my options.

Considering my Quantum drive was still online, and I had enough thrusters to stabilize quantum travel, I hoped, I decided to try to make it back to Tyrol V. The place was pretty run down but maybe I could find someone to hitchhike back home with, plus by the look

of the Merc sitting in my ship’s bed, He’d probably shoot me if I didn’t deliver the girl back to where he had specified.

  

I plot a course back to Tyrol V and my ship limps all the way there.

On approach to Haven, I notice my thrusters are having decreasing amounts of authority. A new warning appears on my HUD.

“MANEUVERING THRUSTERS OVERHEATING.

THRUSTER LINE PRESSURE LOW”

Great. This meant I’d be left with only my retro thrusters before long.

I coast down to the surface, using only my ship’s lower maneuvering thrusters, treating it somewhat like a helicopter.

  

500m above the landing pad I hear a POP….HISS come from the aft end of my ship. My stomach shoots into my mouth as the ship enters free fall above the pad. I try to point the nose down to arrest the fall with my retro thrusters, but the lack of maneuvering thrusters and appreciable atmosphere prevent that from being possible.

  

As we reach the surface, the ship’s right wing collides with the right side of the hangar opening. SLAM, the ship is sent into a rapid counter clockwise roll as the wing separates from the ship. It’s short lived as the ship impacts the ground hard on its roof. All the ceiling glass shatters as my seat’s airbag restraints deploy, just barely holding me in the seat. I hear a sickening SNAP as my collar bones break.

I hear two distinct thuds simultaneously in the rear of the ship as the merc and girl impact the hangar floor, falling where the ship’s glass ceiling once was. The girl is tightly wrapped in the Merc’s arms, and the Merc’s armor seems to have protected him from the fall.

  

Then, silence.
