MISSION CLOCK: 6D, 14H, 23M.
N-ID: 615997 - Commander - Wraiths
CALLSIGN: CEPHEUS
NAME: ERR
SYSTEM: STANTON
SHIP: NSS POINT OF NO RETURN - ORIGIN 400i
LOCATION: DEEP SPACE

  

Eight days I’ve been out here. Sitting in deep space, somewhere between Crusader and ArcCorp. For a mini space yacht the 400i does become a tiny bit claustrophobic after around six days I’ve found. I’m here on a mission however.

  

I had my 23rd birthday a couple weeks ago. Cass threw me a nice little party with some friends we made in Orison, and life has turned almost normal for me since the Kudre raid. The immediate persons responsible for the Orphanage have been brought to justice.

  

Now of course I’ve been busy working with my squadron, and searching Stanton for any further locations run by the Syndicate, the organization ultimately behind the Orphanage, for those who don't know.

But I’ve been able to sleep just a tiny bit better at night knowing Malachite is in NOVA prison, or dead, or whatever they’ve done with him. NOVA HC doesn’t email me updates on his status, nor do I wish them to.

  

The EMP induced failure of my suit has been driving me a bit mad however. I’ve locked myself in my 400i in deep space just to force myself to solve these problems.

I thought I had this fool-proof plan of enhanced protection, enhanced vision, anonymity, everything. But the fact that Malachite was able to blind me in the most critical moment of his capture was a big hit to that feeling of invincibility that had crept into me.

Luckily of course Archangel was able to take him down anyways, and the biggest part of me that was hurt was my ego, but still, the time for change has come.

  

So for the last month I’ve been searching for an alternative. A way to maintain my anonymity and protection but render stuff like EMP’s less of a direct hazard. Since it seems the Syndicate has possession of technology that presents a solid threat to such full faced helmet systems.

  

So here I sit, in the cargo bay of my 400i, which I’ve turned into a sort of makeshift garage, with tables, workstations, computers, and of course my new armor suits in the making. My old Artimex suit that was used in the Kudre raid is sitting on one of the tables, mostly disassembled. I had determined a specially rigged EMP with a very specific frequency had overloaded the visual matrix in the helmet, as well as caused a positive feedback cascade in the armor’s power supply, overheating it almost instantly and causing it to shut down, while also severely damaging the visual systems. A two punch which blinded me and powered me down.

  

There are secondary battery systems but due to how the EMP overloaded the distribution circuits, it all went down to cool off, until Archangel was able to manually reset it. The vision systems can be powered by a supplementary battery within the helmet itself in the event of a main power loss, but the EMP took care of that by overstimulating the cameras with the specific electronic frequencies they operated on, and causing them to shut down for self preservation, while also causing permanent damage to about half of the matrix, which resulted in those blind spots I saw after booting back up.

In the Carrack after the operation I was able to get it back somewhat functional, and Archangel was gracious enough to allow me some privacy in the crew quarters of the NSS Emilia to do so within. This is why I was able to see in that same helmet during the Interrogation of Malachite.

  

Anyways, enough of a debrief there.

The new armor sets I have planned solve these problems. For my flight gear I have chosen the Oracle helmet, which has open eye holes, with a diamond laminate covering for protection, and some red flourish over the eyes to do at least a little bit of obscuration. That said, you can see a tiny bit of my scar, and of course my eyes themselves…. But hey… Progress, right?

  

I copied and uploaded the HUD system and profile I’d created for the Artimex suit and it has adapted mostly well to the Oracle helmet. The HUD projectors work a bit differently than just overlaying information onto an already fully digital screen, but I’m able to make it work. I have lost the infrared, xray, and other vision modes, but have at least been able to maintain night vision. I didn't use the others very much anyways so it’s fine.

  

For the armor I’m going a bit back to basics and just using a suit of TrueDef. It’s what I’ve mandated my squadron use, so I may as well use it myself. Gold and carbon fiber coloring to point me out as the commander when in peacetime, and I have a secondary suit of red/silver for when we’re in active combat; I don't want to paint myself as a target of value after all.

  

The helmet has enough battery power to work the HUD and breathing systems on its own for a couple days, but the armor suit also has those systems, as well as the reaction control stuff for EVA ops, just like the Artimex had.

  

It’s not as protective, but it is a bit more comfortable for use in a pilot’s seat.

  

The Marine armor I have chosen is where it gets interesting. I have a suit of ORC MkX, the same platform NOVA uses as standard, but painted red and black. For the helmet I’m using the Morozov Redshift. It’s fully enclosed but it uses lenses for the eyes instead of a pure screen. I have all of my squadron using this of course, with the intention of using it for when we ourselves need to get stuff done on foot.

  

For my own suit I’ve ported over the same HUD systems from my Artimex and Oracle helmets. This suit handled them a bit easier than the Oracle did.

  

The ORC MkX has much better armor than the Artimex did, and the enclosed helmet gives me peace of mind. It’s also got some other fancy gadgets that I’m not gonna disclose here, just yet.

  

I will say I’m very happy that with either suit, I could suffer a full power failure on all accounts and still see, goddamnit. I can still fend for myself. If I didn’t have the miraculous Archangel (living up to your name, huh buddy?) covering me when Malachite zapped me I can only imagine how bad that would have been. I probably wouldn't be sitting here writing this log.

  

I finish uploading the new 3.0 software onto the Oracle helmet, unplug it and give it a look over. New, polished, and ready for action, I hope.

I put it on, and power it up. The HUD comes alive, now red instead of blue. The more angular blue HUD elements have been replaced with some more smooth and rounded red elements, matching the red overlay that sits on top of the eyes.

  

One by one the systems come online. Targeting, night vision, health monitors, G-force readouts, system monitors, suit status, and a ship link which relays the Point Of No Return’s status and position in real time.

  

All systems check green and minimize to an icon bar at the bottom of the HUD. Everything looks great. This is good.

  

I take off the helmet and sit it aside for a bit more tinkering before I consider it ‘done’.

Just a couple more days out here and I should be ready to head out…

Before I forget… I pull up my MobiGlas and set a reminder to give ShaRroos a call. She is a mechanic within NOVA who was recommended to me, for some… advanced ship inspections. She’s sure to be less expensive and a little more above-board than Italina anyhow… It’s coming time for Point Of No Return’s yearly regulatory inspection, so I figure I should schedule that for sometime shortly after I finish out here.

  

Well… back to work.
