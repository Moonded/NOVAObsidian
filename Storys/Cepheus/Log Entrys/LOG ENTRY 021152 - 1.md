My short vacation back at home, or… Staycation? I don’t know anymore man, was uneventful except for some recurrent nightmares. It has been nice to settle in a little with Cass. Just this morning I was at the August Dunlow Spaceport, planning to go on a small recreational flight, since I rarely get to fly for myself anymore, when I saw a familiar female face, holding a Space Whale plushie, looking around in one of the shops at the spaceport.

  

Is that… Italina? The mega secretive engineer was just standing there out in the open, shopping around. I don't know why that surprised me. I didn’t receive any message about a meeting… But if she’s here at the same time I am, this isn't a coincidence.

  

I walk up to her, wearing a Crusader T-shirt, some black pants and mag boots. “Italina… What are you doing here?” I ask her. “Multitasking… Meeting you, among other things.” she replies slyly. Before I could say anything, she continued “I appreciate you sending those photos I asked for. That’ll be useful for me. All that said, you and your friends are hunting someone, yes? A… Malachite I believe?”. “Yeah, we are. And how did you know I was going to be-... Ehh, don’t answer that.” I replied. “Well, Considering what you’ve done for me in the past, and recently, and I also kind of like you a little…” she continued. “This might help you.” She tapped her MobiGlas, performing a flinging gesture my way with her fingers.

  

My Mobi buzzed briefly, and I opened it to see an encrypted message from her, only containing a set of coordinates. “CRUSADER, DAYMAR, OM1-418,OM3-238.3,OM5-432.2” I saved the coordinates before the message deleted itself quickly thereafter, and closed my Mobi. By the time I looked back up from my MobiGlas, Italina was gone. “Damn, why does she always have to be like this.” I said under my breath.

  

Since this is going in the logs… I guess it’s high time to explain why I have a connection to such a shady figure. Well, here goes.

  

BEGIN MEMORY

  

YEAR: 2950

  

After the encounter with Borlathar in Ruin Station, my injury, and short checkout in the sketchy hospital after it was determined I couldn't afford treatment anyways, I loaded back on my only ship at the time, an Origin 325a, the Ready Or Not. After trading in the Avenger Titan my late father had left me to inherit, I had saved enough money doing my illicit deliveries to buy myself a brand new 325a, customized with an Obsidian black paint job, carbon fiber interior, the works.

Looking back on it now, It was very much a typical “drug smugglers” ship to anyone who knew anything about smuggling drugs.

  

I took the Ready or Not back home, to the IAS Hammett, a station orbiting Terra. I had moved out there a couple years back, after receiving the aforementioned Avenger Titan and making some money. Man, I was so eager to move out; a bit premature looking back on it. Oh well, live and learn.

  

Upon landing at Hammett, I disembarked my ship, and I walked into the elevator and took it to my hab. I rented a nice little unit in that station. Wasn't cheap but the views of Terra from its windows were phenomenal. I took my helmet off and set it in my armor locker, beginning to unzip my suit at the same time.

I took it off and stepped in the shower. The hot water burned my fresh facial scar terribly. A step up compared to the constant aching burn that always taunted my cheek now.

  

I had to figure out something. I had now… I checked my mobiglas… 20 hours to come up with just over a half million credits. Not good.

After washing myself clean of Ruin Station’s grime, which I always felt got underneath my hermetically sealed undersuit somehow, I stepped out of the shower, threw some casual civilian clothes on, and laid on my couch, completely stumped for ideas of what to do.

  

Do I run? Do I hide? Do I fake my death, or get myself killed for real? All of those options feel better than what Borlathar promised to do to me.

Maybe I should just-.... My mobiglas beeped.

  

I opened it up and I saw there was a message, asking for help with a rescue mission… Details upon acceptance. 500,000UEC up front, and 500,000UEC on completion…

  

Well. Best case this mission gets me the money to pay off the Ninetails, and all is well. Worst case this mission gets me killed and it isn't my problem anyways.

  

I accept the mission, and the message that is sent reads “TYROL V: HAVEN. LANDING ZONE 12, PAD 1, HABITATION SECTION, ROOM 24B. COME ALONE. COME ARMED.”

  

Tyrol… That abandoned science system? I didn't think anyone but smugglers, squatters and… ah… Well… Got it.

  

I switched to the starmap page on my mobiglas and calculated a route to Tyrol from Terra. Two jumps… One jump through Goss. Not too far. I can make it in a few hours.

Just a moment later 500,000UEC pops into my bank account. This isn't going to be enough… Something tells me this mission will take a little bit, and if I don’t pay Ninetails on time… I’m dead anyways. They don’t accept late money.

  

I write a message back to the anonymous mission giver. “I need more funds to pay off a… personal debt, and fuel to get to you. I need an extra 100k up front. Take 100k off the total price, for my honesty. Forwarding my ship’s flight plan to you now.”

…

…

…

“ACKNOWLEDGED. DO NOT BE LATE.” was sent in reply, with a deadline timer attached reading 12 hours, counting down.

At that moment another 100,000UEC hit my account. A wave of relief washed over me. 600,000UEC is enough to pay back Borlathar and… make it to this mission. I have to survive this too, I guess. Oh well.

  

I opened up my Mo.Trader app and sent Borlathar 510,586UEC. Okay, 89,414UEC remaining in my account. That's enough to buy some gear and fuel for Tyrol.

  

I head out of my hab, down to the elevator and stop by the weapons and armor shop in the Hammett. I buy myself a full DustUp set of armor, a new S-38 pistol, a P4-AR rifle, a couple med pens, some ammo for the guns, and have them sent to my hangar.

  

I jog down to my hangar, equip the gear, donning the armor over my Stoneskin Undersuit, and attaching the weapons to the armor’s magnetic mounts.

I tap my mobiglas while turning to look at the Ready Or Not, she chirps and the door hisses and pops open, the ladder sliding out and lowering to the ground.

  

Here goes nothing.

  

I board the ship, slot the pistol and rifle into the weapon racks at the back of the ship, and I stow my armor in the compartment labeled as such, I check the fridge is stocked with enough food and water for the trip, and then sit in the pilot seat and flip the appropriate switches to bring the ship to life.

  

I call Hammett air traffic control, get them to open my hangar door, and launch out at lightning speed. I plug the quantum routing into my ship’s computer, and start a quantum jump to the Terra>Goss jump gate.
