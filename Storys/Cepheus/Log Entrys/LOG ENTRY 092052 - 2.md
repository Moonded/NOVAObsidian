PART 2 OF X**

I made my way out of my hospital room, equipped with nothing but a shitty scavenged hodgepodge of an undersuit, and the brain in my skull.

I wander the decrepit, dimly lit hallways of this “Hospital” and find my way to a central area. I look around until I find a flickering neon sign which reads “Neutrality”.
I had spent some time in Ruin Station during my couple years on the wrong side of the law… But I never went far beyond the “shipping and receiving” sections the various gangs used for… “deliveries”. This place always creeped me the fuck out. 

From what I recall, Neutrality is the bar on Ruin Station… one of very few safe places on this station. Whatever passes for “Safe” in Pyro. I never went here, as I was very ‘in and out’ during my visits. Time is money when delivering stuff. 

I enter the bar and hear the hushed roar of numerous people chatting, shitty rap music playing, and drinks clinking. I look around, surveying the people. There’s big beefy bouncers with rifles standing in nearly every corner, with a mean look to them. This definitely is not the place to cause trouble. Not that I planned to anyways. 

As I search around my eyes land on a lone figure wearing a full suit of Artimex combat armor, sitting at a table. 
You don’t often see lone folks sitting at a bar like this… Like that… he appears to be waiting for someone. Seeing as he’s the only person with that vibe about him… something tells me he’s my guy. 

The sight of an Artimex suit brings some pained nostalgia in me. A reminder of my past face, in a way. He had an S71 assault rifle and Arrowhead sniper attached to his back, but he sat almost perfectly still.

“Are… You my guy?” I say, walking up slowly to him. He nods. “Sit.” He says, in a low electronically modulated voice.

Wait a moment…
My eyes light up as I recognize the armor and voice.
“Are you… Tyrol… Haven… about two years back?” I say, stuttering a bit. 
He nods again. 
This is the merc I worked with to rescue Italina’s sister! That means… Wait…. What does that mean?

“You found me?” I say, a dumbfounded look involuntarily plastered across my unhidden face. 
He nods.
“You brought me here?” I continue.
He nods.
“Why did you save me?”
He shrugs. 
I shrug back, becoming a bit frustrated.
“I detected your cargo. Went to investigate. Saw you get blown apart by *them*. Grabbed you…. Took a bit to find you in the debris field. Brought you here to safety.” The merc finally said. 

“You… Detected my cargo?” I said, eyebrows lowering. 
“Yes. That was some very… sensitive technology you had in your ship there. Negated all of that fancy ‘stealth’ tech.” He said, putting a layer of sarcasm on the word ‘stealth’. 
A bubble of anger simmered beneath my skin. I suppressed it as I knew I needed to stay cool here if I was to get out alive, and in one piece.

“Why here?” I ask.
“No Syndicate here. No NineTails here… Seeing as you have that lovely price tag on your face…. And I was coming here anyway.” he said. 

“I have no MobiGlas, suit, or ship. How the hell am I supposed to leave here?” I ask, my voice raising a bit outside of my perception.
“Shhhh. I wouldn’t advertise you have no ability to defend yourself *or* call for help here… Even though this place is ‘safe’, don’t get reckless.” he says, the lit facia of his Artimex helmet shifting blue to red for just a moment. 
My hands ball up into fists inadvertently as my frustration builds.
“I’d suggest scavenging a bit. There’s lots of people here on this station who… don’t need such things anymore…” the Merc said. 

“You expect me to loot the dead on this station? Can’t you give me some UEC to just buy a damn MobiGlas?” I say, ensuring I keep my voice hushed. 
“No.” The Merc snaps back.

My upper lip curls back in a snarl. “Grrhh.. Why not?!” I reply, my voice raising again. 
“Be quiet or I will quiet you.” The Merc said, standing up. A cold chill ran down my aching spine. “Alright, fine. Fuck it anyways.” I say, turning around and walking out of the bar.

I guess I’m on my own.

I leave the bar and turn back to the “hospital” area… if you can call it that.

I wander down the halls for a couple hours, checking all the “unsecured” rooms. God, if you don’t pay the money, they wont even keep anybody out of your room while you’re in there. Who knows what sick fucks could get in your room while you’re unconscious and do… Ugh I can’t even think about it. 

Every room I’ve found with someone either unconscious or dead has been looted clean of anything remotely valuable. 

Finally I come across an occupied room with a steady “beeeeeeeep” coming from behind the door. I open it and see a corpse still warm on the med bed, recently deceased from the look of the monitor panels. This feels wrong… So fucking wrong.

He has a Mobiglas on his wrist.. 
I walk up and reluctantly unlatch it from the dead arm.
I put it on my own wrist, the hauntingly warm inner band of the Mobi chilling my soul. 

The Mobi holo display comes to life and I’m immediately greeted with a “**ENTER PASSCODE:**”


God fucking DAMNIT! 

I rip the Mobi off my wrist and throw it at the wall so hard it shatters on impact. 

“Whoa whoa, settle down there fella… What’s got you so worked up?” A female voice behind me says, a heavy back country accent covering her words.
