I had just finished my meeting with Archangel and his squad, the Catulan Reavers. We discussed the Orphanage and what I’d found so far. During the meeting, it seems Malachite sent out some sort of warning to someone, probably the Orphanage staff if I were to guess. I don't think he’s on our side at all. Of course as this was happening, some fight hungry new guy decided he was going to be the hero and go catch this Freelancer, and now he’s M.I.A. Wonderful.

  

I made it back to my temporary apartment in Area 18. I will never get tired of that pop the helmet seal makes when it releases, especially that first breath of fresh, unfiltered air. Even if it isn't quite as sweet here as it is back on Orison. I put my pistol in my gun safe, and took off my armor piece by piece.

  

I was just getting ready to settle in for bed when I got a call on my Mobi.

  

I answer and hear a familiar feminine voice on the other end. “Ah, Ceph! Long time no speak!” It’s an old acquaintance of mine, an engineer at the Riker Memorial Spaceport here, Italina. I had... delivered...or....rescued, whichever you prefer, her older sister from a rather nasty group of pirates a couple years back. In return she did some very special modifications to The Point Of No Return. Since then she has been my go-to for maintenance and upgrades whenever I'm around ArcCorp. “Ah, Hey Italina! How are you?” I replied to her. “Good, good! I’ll get to the point. A contact of mine happened to witness someone who appeared to be with NOVA get... err... misplaced inside a Freelancer. You joined up with them recently, didn't you?” She said. What a coincidence this is... This happened literally a couple hours ago. “Yeah. What do you know?” I replied. “Well, my contact happens to have security recordings, as well as the

flight plan of that freelancer, and he has decided he wants to hand it over to NOVA.” Italina continued.

  

I've been around the “knowing things and information” business long enough to know this information won't be free. But... This could be very important information. It's not a secret that the Freelancer would likely lead to the Orphanage. That's why the new guy sprinted towards the thing like an idiot. But considering he’s M.I.A, they pretty much certainly discovered him and are going to take him somewhere else.

“Alright, has he named a price?” I asked her.

“No. He just gave me a location to give you, asked to come alone and unarmed.” She said, “Wonderful. Send the location to me. I'll handle it.” I said, hanging up the call.

Moments later I received a set of coordinates pointing to a dead end alley in Zone 2 around A18. Great. I really wanted to get mugged today. And come UNARMED? This guy has got to be joking.

  

Well. The civvies were nice while they lasted.

I got up and put my armor back on, piece by piece. No way I'm going to some random back alley basically naked. By my standards anyways. After my light armor totally failed me on that busted mission back on Orison, Medium or heavier is the way to go for me now. Quirinus Tech’s Artimex set has worked very well for me since I got it a little while ago.

I grabbed a super compact pistol, and stowed it inside a compartment in my armor. Quickly accessible, but out of sight. I'll at least appear unarmed. I also grabbed a couple knives and slid them into slots under my forearms. Never hurts to have a backup plan.

  

I grabbed my helmet, the inside still a little damp from sweat.... Ugh fuck I hate having to put armor back on after a long day.

  

The helmet clicked into place, sealed up, and with a nice pop, returned the all too familiar metallic tinge of filtered air. The Synthetic vision system, and HUD came online as all the helmet’s cameras and sensors woke up. I set it to normal vision mode, pretty much indistinguishable from not wearing a helmet, except for the small AR prompts that would appear contextually. I love this gear, man.

  

I set a waypoint to the alley way the coordinates pointed to, and headed out.
