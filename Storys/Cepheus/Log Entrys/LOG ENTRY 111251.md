The rumble of the Point of No Return’s QT drive hummed pleasantly underneath the rock music blasting through my ship speakers. I was nearing completion on some work I was doing on a secondary avionics computer that has been acting up lately. I was getting ready to seal the unit back up when my MobiGlas buzzed with a notification.

A message from Dolbi, the Frontiers’ Admiral. It contained some disturbing news about a place in Lyria called ‘The Orphanage’.

Now I’ve heard some whispers about this place before, but nothing concrete. I did however know someone who might know some details. An old friend of mine from a past life who I’d kept in touch with.  

I closed the message on my MobiGlas, turned off the music and sealed up that avionics unit, sliding it back into its housing and watch it retract back into the compartment with a satisfying hiss.... click.  

I took the elevator up to the habitation deck of my 400i, and sat down at my chair in the Captain’s Quarters. I opened up my MobiGlas and gave my old friend a call. 

ring..... Ring...... ring..... “Uh... Hello?” a deep, rough voice spoke.

“Ah, yeah it’s Cepheus, I ran with that group you were in back in ‘49.” I replied.

“Oh! Yeah, Ceph! How are you doing? It’s been a long while.” the man said back to me, his tone noticeably lighter than when he first answered. “I'm good, but hey, I wanted to ask if you know anything about an ‘Orphanage’ on Lyria. The organization I’m with now is doing some investigation and I know you ran...or run in the circles around that area.” I explained.

“The Orphanage... Yeah. Dark place, that. I have never been there myself, but one of my other buddies has. Apparently they are taking in children orphaned during the Xenothreat Incursions, and turning them into drug peddlers.” the voice said. My heart sank. Kids? Drug running? Jeez. When the Stanton underworld got too rough for me, I left. This was over a year ago. 

Now they’re using orphan kids to transport and sell their drugs?  

“They don't seem to stop there either. Apparently some awfully young folk have been spotted inside the drug lab, manufacturing the drugs.” he said. Damn. This is serious. They’re using up vulnerable kids for their own gain!  

“If your org is doing some digging, advise them to be careful. They have heavy defenses. They don't like people poking around.” he finished. “Got it. That's some serious stuff man. We’re planning to do something about it. Thanks for thintel. Take care. Ceph out.” I said, hanging up the call afterwards.  

I immediately opened a message to Dolbi and pasted a copy of the transcript of that call, adding on at the end; “This is from a trusted contact of mine, if he says something is bad, it’s worse. We have to do something and shut this place down.... I will offer my support as soon as I finish this solo operation I’m working on. Got some small time baddies of my own to deal with. Till then.”  

Message Sent.  

The Point Of No Return’s QT drive made that signature sound that indicated deceleration. I grabbed my helmet off my desk, put it on, and then got up and headed to the bridge.  

As I sat down, the 400i’s controls lit up, and the ship dropped out of quantum. The planet Hurston filled the windscreen.  

Alright, back to the mission. It’s time to get to work.
