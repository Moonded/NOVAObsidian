It’s been a while since I’ve had time to sit down and write one of these. I was promoted to commander a couple months back and I’ve formed my own squadron; the Wraiths. We specialize in Close Air Support. It’s been a lot of fun but has cut into my time significantly. As such I’d been tied up in that and unable to focus on the Malachite situation until a couple weeks ago when I finally had time to chase down that lead that Italina had given me. I had shared my findings with Archangel a couple weeks ago and now it’s finally time. We’re gonna find the bastard and bring him in.

  

I assigned my squad’s Lieutenant temporary command of the Wraiths while I dealt with this, and got to work.

  

During my meeting with Arch he commented on the damn breathing sounds coming from my Artimex helmet… I gotta do something about that. I had already spent hours tweaking it before, and the Db meter I checked it with registered it at no higher than background noise. Arch must have some sort of hearing implant I swear.

  

Ruffling sounds are heard as I pick up the recorder and stick it to the mag mount on my undersuit’s chest.

  

So here we are. I just finished cleaning and triple checking all of my armor’s systems. I have a fully loaded and freshly cleaned S71 rifle, and S38 pistol, plenty of extra ammo. I had commissioned the armor to be painted a beige camouflage in preparation for this op, which takes place at the Kudre Ore mine on Daymar, where Malachite appears to be hiding.

My helmet is now working perfectly. I changed some filters and tuned the exhaust valves and I got it even quieter than before. The video feed systems are working, with my Infrared, Sonar, Radio, and UV vision systems up and running now. I’m aware the whole full faced helmet with electronic displays as a visor is a bit of a weak point in the eyes of many Marines. I’ve heard that a lot now that my Wraiths squadron is officially considered Marine, even though we exclusively fly ships in combat.

  

The way I see it, I’d rather the extra bullet protection to the face as opposed to some slightly better visibility and redundancy. Besides, I’ve been using this helmet over a year and I’ve never had so much as static on the display in combat.

It’s got four cameras for EACH EYE’S display! I don’t get what they’re talking about. Besides, the amount of helmets which utilize clear glass eye protection while still covering most of your face is limited, and sadly I’m still not ready to go around showing off my mug to everyone. Not like there’s much to see anyways.

I pick up my Artimex helmet and hold it, facing towards me. I run my fingers over the smooth metal exterior. I press the power button at the rear base of the helmet, powering on its systems. The blue lighted ‘visor’ slowly glows as it warms up.

  

I spin the helmet around and put it on my head, my eyes adjusting to the lensed screens inside the helmet. There’s a soft click as the log’s recording switches from the chest mounted mic to the helmet’s internal microphone. The world outside the helmet brightens and focuses, the HUD now coming alive. Angular blue peripheral detailing blinks on, and AR markers begin appearing. Heart rate, health monitors, environmental details, all the glorious information I enjoy having at the sides of my vision manifests into existence. The body diagram at the bottom left corner turns gray, detecting the fact that I’m just wearing an undersuit aside from the helmet.

  

The helmet's neural interpretation sensors come online, and I’m now able to manipulate the helmet’s controls and systems by thought. I first test the helmet’s rebreathers. With a subtle thud The external vents close and the air inside begins to taste slightly metallic as I breath the filtered and scrubbed air. I flip it back to outside air, and then test the different vision systems. Night Vision, thermal, and more.

  

Back to normal vision, I look around the room, clear as could be. Honestly you can’t even tell you’re looking through a screen, that is if you ignore the HUD and other vision systems. For that there’s even a “casual” mode which minimizes most of the HUD and allows you to see as if you aren't wearing anything but those MobiGlas contact lenses, or a fully open face helmet, like the Odyssey.

  

Wearing the helmet, I then walk over to the armor stand in the side of the room, housing my Artimex suit. I put it on, and as I click and latch each piece into place, it blinks blue on my HUD, indicating it’s connected and working properly. With the full suit on, I run a general diagnostic and test of all the systems. The battery, the o2 supply, the EVA Thruster fuel. I’m not taking any chances with such a critical operation later today.

  

Diagnostic systems come back in the blue. I pick up my S71 rifle and immediately an ammo counter, condition status and aiming reticule come up on my HUD. Beautiful. I latch the rifle onto the Artimex’s back mounted magnetic hoop which is designed to unobtrusively carry rifles and equipment. It’s not the most comfortable for sitting down in ships, but I get by. I’ve even modified my own ship’s pilot seats to utilize that hoop as a part of the seat’s safety restraints.

  

I latched my S38 pistol sidearm onto my thigh, as well as a Med gun, some extra magazines, and some food went into the internal compartments in the chest.

  

Everything checks. Now, I just have to catch this Malachite bastard and not get killed in the process.

  

I call up ArchangelCorps on the Mobi and inform him I’m ready. He informs me of our rendezvous point and I acknowledge, ending the call. Now or never. Let’s go.
