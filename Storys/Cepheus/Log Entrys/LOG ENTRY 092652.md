LOCATION: NOVA HQ - AREA 18 - ARCCORP**

Some light conversation had been nice on board the NSS Emelia. He caught me up on some of the events of the time during my absence. Seeing Archangel’s face after my time in Pyro has been a sweet relief, all in all. As much as the crew looked at me kind of as if I was a Xi’an spy, It felt as safe as the UEE HQ compared to Pyro. 

Arch and I even spoke face to face for the first time. Come to think, I believe he’s the first person in NOVA to see my face. Ah well. I think I owed it to the man, after all he’s done for me. Not only picking me up upon my return, but sticking up for me for the long, suspicious time I was gone. 

We arrived at Area 18 about a half hour later. I was surprised with how smoothly Arch’s pilot handled the massive Carrack into the hangar. I should chat with that guy some time later. 

Cut forward a bit and I made my way to NOVA HQ, and their Intelligence wing. I end up in an interrogation room, with a large, rough looking man in NOVA dress uniform. He wore the badge of a Wing Commander, and lacked a name plate. Per NOVA HQ protocols I left my weaponry and armor in the security checkpoint prior to the Intel wing. 

I sat in the metal chair in the interrogation room, my Sabine Undersuit and myself being all I had.

The dark haired Wing Commander sat down in the chair opposite me, across a table in the center of the brightly lit room. They made it clear I wasn’t a prisoner, but that I had a lot of explaining to do. I’m sure my clean tenure at NOVA, plus my Commander rank has helped my case a lot. I’m sure Archangel’s vouching for me is the biggest reason I’m not in cuffs. Of course all of that is muddied up by my past on the other side of the law, my criminal record and skill set. I spent several hours in that room with the unnamed wing commander, detailing the extent of everything I did while in Pyro, as well as the circumstances which led me there. Many uncomfortable questions were raised and answered about the Point Of No Return and its modifications. I answered everything that was asked of me of course… But the dissatisfaction on the interrogator’s face was clearly apparent. Then we got to the armor…
“So you met with this… Borlathar. The man who gave you that scar on your face?” The Wing Co asked. “Yeah. We have a history.” I replied. “Towards the end of your time in Pyro, you mentioned you ended up fighting him, victoriously.” He continued. I nodded in response. “So why did you take, and then wear his armor, to here?” He prodded, a suspicious undertone to his voice. “I initially took his armor out of necessity. I needed something air tight to get out of Ruin via the Mustang I had ridden to that hangar. However when the Mustang broke down, I ended up using it as a sort of disguise to make my way through Ruin to where I could get the means to escape.” I explained. 

“And then you kept wearing it to Stanton, to NOVA HQ? Are you aware that the NineTails use trackers in their soldier’s armor?” The man questioned. I scoffed, “Of course I know that. When I put the armor on I saw it was basically a completely unmodified Hurston Dynamics set of Artimex. Of course HD kept their own trackers, but those had been crudely removed as evidenced by the scratch marks over the chest piece's rear access hatch under the cape.” I said confidently. “I checked in there myself and had noticed Borlathar, or the Tails, hadn’t had time to install their own tracker yet. I imagine HD’s firmware is a bit more complicated to attach a third party tracker to than a stock Artimex set.” I continued.

The man nodded softly. “I see.” “So, I intend to use the armor myself. As a sign to the Nines. As a sign to myself.” I said. “I’ll modify it of course. Firstly with appropriate IFF hardware and software for NOVA.” I finished.

“It’s still out of regulation, you know.” He challenged. “Yes. It is. But a Commander can designate a uniform for themselves and their Squadron, no?” “Yes they can, but that uniform has regulation constraints. I’m sure a stolen set of Artimex from the NineTails and formerly Hurston Dynamics is outside of that regulation.” The interrogator said.

“I’m sure whatever rules there might be can be waived for extenuating circumstances. Just pass it by my Wing Commander, ArchangelCorps.” I say dismissively. Was the guy right? Sure. Technically NOVA wouldn’t allow wearing something like that under their flag. But I’ve got my own plans for this suit. It won’t be ‘formerly NineTails and Hurston Dynamics’ for long. 

“You must be aware that the circumstances of your disappearance, and then the events that happened during your AWOL period, paint you in a very poor light. Then you return wearing *that* gear…” “Yes, yes. I know. That armor represents something to me though, now. Consider it a personal memento of sorts…” I said with a slight smirk. 
“Ugh.” the man huffed.
“You can keep it for now, I guess. But we will be contacting your Wing Commander and the admiralty associated with your squadron, to decide what to do. Luckily for you, Archangel, and your Lieutenant gave the strongest of good-will vouches for you in your absence. You better be careful for the future though… We will be watching closely.” The man said. 
“Yeah I know that. I have no issues with that, either. Is there any other information you need from me?” I asked.

“One last thing…” The interrogator said, flipping through the data pad sat on the table. 
“Your discussion earlier, and log report from your Mobiglas state that you had encountered an individual who went by Miss S. Can you tell me any more about her?” He said. I had seen this coming, and am happy to give details. 
“Yeah. S. She is the one who helped me in the first place, and catalyzed my whole escape path. Although it wasn’t exactly clean work, it got me home.” I responded.
“Are you aware she has been linked to multiple Syndicate operations in Pyro?” the man replied.
“No I wasn’t, but I had my suspicions. She had the elements of someone with an ulterior motive.” I replied. What I said was true. “I had assumed she wasn’t there by coincidence. Seeing as how the Syndicate are the ones that left me for dead, and then my unknown mercenary friend, and adversary of the Syndicate, had brought me to Pyro, it makes sense that the Syndicate would have sent someone to keep tabs on me, and see what I’d do. Considering my role in the Orphanage attack and other subsequent ops, I have no doubt I’m on the Syndicate’s POI list.” I explained.

“Yes. And as such, I have no further questions. You are to meet Archangel immediately and report to him, he will have your next specific orders. From NOVA HQ, you are prohibited from participating in any large scale operations, and any involving the NineTails, the Syndicate, or any other related group, until we can complete our internal investigation.” 

I sigh, and reply “Yes sir.” “Good. You are free to leave, you can grab your gear from the checkpoint you entered through. Arch will meet you in the HQ Lobby. You have 3 days to get that IFF sorted, before we remove it from our adjusted IFF Database, and it will be considered a hostile target.” the interrogator finished. “Alright, no problem. I never caught your name?” I said, wanting to mention this guy to Arch later. The man said nothing as he exited the room with military precision.
