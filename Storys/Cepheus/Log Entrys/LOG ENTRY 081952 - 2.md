**PART 2**

Realizing who I might be dealing with here, I hit thrusters full, and turn my ship away from the crowd, turning on my quantum drive.
I set a destination solution to ArcCorp, speed increasing through 500m/s… and then… a blue haze clouds my vision. All systems go black. Not red, not damaged, off. 

Impossible… This ship has the best damn EMP shielding I could buy. 
Or… Yeah that might explain it. 
I reach for the holo panels which no longer exist. I could feel my heart rate rising rapidly as panic started to set in finally, balancing out the adrenaline I hadn’t even noticed. 

I hit the few physical buttons my ship has on its seat armrests, trying to expedite a reboot. I start hearing a rapid series of thunks as the Inferno’s bullets begin to strike the now unshielded hull. I hear hisses and cracks as they penetrate the interior of the lower deck of the ship. 

The holo panels slowly flicker on, the ship lights turning on, now red. I briefly see my ship status screen, showing hull breaches and pressure loss on the lower deck and cargo bay. Before I could attempt to restart the engines,I see that same blue glow in my vision and simultaneously another missile hits the nose of the ship. **WHAM**.

With the magnetic restraints of my pilot seat now inoperative due to another EMP, the missile hit on the nose of the ship sent me out of my seat and towards the ceiling as the ship began to spin nose over tail. 

I land on the ceiling of the ship, now in zero gravity. I look out the front windscreen to see the nose of the ship partially separated, a wrenched mess of cables, wires and struts, glowing red from the impact, just forward of the entry ramp. The internal vehicle bay is completely destroyed, and as evidenced by my floating, the gravity generator is gone too.
Just now realizing I’m not even wearing my helmet, I turn towards the door exiting the bridge. It’s closed, and powered off, so I pull the manual release. The air begins to hiss through the crack of the now slowly opening door. Well, low or no pressure in there… 

I get the door open as the air from the cockpit vents into the already venting upper deck. There's still some air in here, but my ears painfully pop due to the pressure loss. 

I kick off the remaining exposed part of the door and launch myself towards the captain’s quarters, where I’d laid my helmet. 
**BANG BANG BANG, THWACK THWACK, CRACK** I hear weapons battering the hull of the ship. More hisses and sparks and now fire starts emanating from underneath the elevator to the bottom deck. 

The ship shifts and begins to spin in the opposite direction, the change in momentum throwing me towards the aft of the ship, right past my captain’s quarters. I hit the cartography table in the aft of the ship and felt a sharp pain in my back. My fingertips tingled and I realized it was getting hard to breathe. The impact with the table had sent me spinning into the back glass of the upper deck, which I was able to glance out of through pain-squinted eyes. I saw that blue glow from earlier, emanating from a now close range… Is that a Sabre Raven? Jesus Christ I’ve never seen one of those before. Those are absurdly hard to get your hands on… And…– No time.
My mind turning back to the dwindling air pressure in the room, I turn my head back to the hallway containing my captain's quarters. I spot the flames coming from the elevator at the far end beginning to dwindle due to the lack of oxygen. 

I kick off the aft viewport glass and launch myself once again towards my captain’s quarters. I begin to hear thudding against the hull again, dammit not again! 
Although this time I was able to grab the thankfully opened door’s frame. I heaved myself in as the ship then began to rotate again. I held on to the door frame as I swung my legs inward, once the rotation stabilized, my hands now numb and vision turning black and white, I launched myself at my desk, where my helmet was magnetically pinned to the surface. 

I grabbed the Oracle helmet, and in one swift, rehearsed motion, I slid it on my head. 
I took a rapid gasp of metallic, but beautifully fresh and sweet air as the helmet’s systems initialized and provided me with breathable oxygen. 
My HUD came online and started providing me with status updates on my health. A cracked vertebrae from my impact with the cartography table. Some bruising in the same location on my back, and otherwise not too bad. 
Color now returning to my vision, I pop open the drawer next to my desk and grab the S-38 and magazines stored within. I magnetically latch the mags onto my torso, and hold the weapon at the ready.

The 400i’s red emergency lighting flickers on once again, just to immediately be shut off again by another EMP burst from the Raven. Man I was beat before I even dropped from quantum, wasn’t I?

Now with my helmet online and connected, my suit’s EVA thrusters were also online. I thrusted myself out the door to my quarters and up the hall to the elevator. I slid beside the elevator and floated down the ladder to the lower deck. I looked down at the floor to see a wide open glowing red gash about one meter long, with stars visible through the middle. I turned left to the door to the cargo bay, which had slid open halfway due to the lost hydraulic pressure. I floated over to it and pulled it the rest of the way open by hand, revealing a strangely intact cargo bay, with the two boxes of metal sitting in the center, as if nothing was going on. 

Just then, as I floated by the door, I heard a whine. **WHRRRRR…….WHSSSPT…POP**. Creaks and groans followed as I noticed the edges of the cargo bay door began to glow red. Realizing what was likely about to come I grabbed on tight to the door frame and braced as the ship lurched, and the cargo bay door was ripped clean off, including the two cargo boxes mag-secured to it. 

Well… That confirms who this is… What those containers are…and… What a fuckin coincidence, man. 

It occured to me at that moment I should probably verify my ship’s auto distress call function worked, once the first shield face had gone down. I query my HUD and see that the distress call status reads “Sent”. Which is good. Now I just have to hope that-... *thud, thud, thud*. I hear what sounds like footsteps from mag boots on the exterior of the ship. I double check my pistol is loaded, and armed – It is.
