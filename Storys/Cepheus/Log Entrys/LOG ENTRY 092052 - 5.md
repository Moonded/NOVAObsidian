PART 5 OF 12**


A couple hours later, I was absolutely exhausted after combing this ship through, doing repetitive diagnostics, and making sure this thing wouldn’t rip itself apart the second I exited the hangar. I feel like I’ve got it as good as it’s going to get without having a dime to spend. 

I climbed into the pilot seat, flicked on the master power switch and ran one last diagnostic. It came back with all critical systems functional. No shields, No quantum drive, no boost capacitor, reduced drive efficiency, power plant fluctuations and a cooler than mostly worked. The IFCS system inertial guidance computer and gyroscopic reference frame housing was shot, so It’d have limited computer assistance on the fly by wire… No coupled flight or auto stop on the command axis. But it should be good enough to get me a few klicks in space. 

I power down the ship and drop down from the pilot seat. 
I make my way out of the hangar and to the market district in the “Neutral” section of Ruin Station. Very few, or no ninetails here. Mostly Xenothreat and Cousins. Neither of which have a beef with me or my face. 

I finally stumble upon a very, very, small shack with a flickering red neon sign titled “GrIm’S GrAmS”. The sole occupant of the stand was a scrawny kid, maybe in his late teens? I walk up to him.
“Oi, whadda you wan?” he says in a thick english accent, sounding like he’s halfway to upscale Terra. “Uh… What can I get for this?” I say, pulling out the old UPE coin from my pocket and showing it to the kid.
“Ooh…” he says, his blue eyes lighting up as he takes a closer look.
“You gonna wanna see Grim for that.” he says.

“Okay… Take me to him, then?” I say, trying to sound nice… Maybe following the advice of the Merc.
“Sure thing bruv.” he says, hopping up from the ripped up padded stool he was sitting on. He walks over behind the stand and I follow him down a narrow, dark alleyway.

I’m either about to be hooked up with a really good set of gear, hooked up on a meat hook, or just have my head cut off here. I am kind of thankful for not having anything valuable on my person just about now.

We eventually enter a small room with a TV and some chairs in it, a shaggy carpet in the middle and a man sitting on a metal chair at a workbench, toying with what looked to be a broken MobiGlas. This could be good.

“Oi Grim, I got one o’ Angel’s guys here to see you.” the kid says, tossing the coin at the man and then quickly turning and sprinting back to the front of the stand. I turn to look at the back of the man who’s leaning over his workbench.
He turns to face me. An old man… Probably in his seventies. Gray hair, a gray beard which extended midway down his chest, a T-shirt on which had the vinyl printed letters spelling out “BULLSH!T” on it with a skull. 
He locked his green eyes with mine, ran a couple shaky fingers through his thin gray hair and says “Well, I don’t see many of you here anymore.” 

“Many of who…?” I say, confused. “Of Angel’s friends. Of course.” He says.
“Ah… Well… I just need some gear, alright? What can you give me for that coin?” I say.

“Hmm… Those coins are usually entitled to a set of standard gear, and your choice of pistol.” he says.

“Ah… Well… I just need some gear, alright? What can you give me for that coin?” I say.

The workings of this whole interaction have me bewildered. Is this some kind of regular activity that the Merc has? Why are they calling him Angel? Are we thinking of the same guy? Was this “Angel” someone the Merc killed and looted? I honestly don’t care as long as I can get some vacuum ready gear and maybe some defense.
“Okay… I’ll take that then.” I say, desperate to get out of this grimy backwater as soon as possible.

“Hmm… Lets see now..." he says, as he slowly gets out of his chair and, holding a stick, slowly walks to the back of the room, quickly does something and I see the wall slide out of the way. Revealing a large area filled with dust and cobwebs. In the corner of my eye I spot something moving out of the way, fast.

I follow him into the room, covering my mouth to avoid getting the dust into my lungs. He unlocks a few containers, revealing a rather surprisingly good condition TCS-4 undersuit in gray, with a StoneSkin helmet sitting next to it. I haven't seen one of those since…. Borlathar… Oh Jeez the thought of running into him hadn’t even occurred to me.

Next to the suit and helmet laid a row of pistols and magazines. “Here’s your kit, and choose your preferred pistol.”

In the row lay an LH-86, Coda, Arclight, and S-38 pistol, all in good condition. 

“I’ll take the S-38.” I say, that being my preference.

He nods and grabs it, checking the chamber, making sure it’s empty, and swiping a trio of magazines and handing it all to me. “There you are. You best get out of here.” He says.

I tuck the undersuit and helmet under my arm and grab the pistol and magazines clumsily in my hands.

“Thank-” I begin to say, “Take the back exit and tell Angel that the next time I see one of these coins, it better be him holding it.”  


As he sits down, I quickly slide out the back and make my way out of the immediate vicinity of that shop, and find a restroom nearby. I enter it and begin to change into the TCS-4 suit. It was much cleaner than the hodgepodge suit I was previously wearing. I didn’t even realize how dirty that one was until I peeled it off my flesh and it left a sticky residue… Oh lord. I put down the TCS suit and walk over to the shower module of the restroom. Luckily this section of Ruin was very sparsely inhabited.I enter one of the shower stalls and press the hot water button… Nothing happens.
Great. I guess that’s why this section of the station is barely inhabited. 

I walk over back to the place I’d set the undersuit, somehow feeling more gross after being denied a shower than before I knew it was even an option. 

I put on the TCS-4 and zip it up, then grabbing the StoneSkin helmet and putting it on my head. It actually smelled fresh inside, like it was… New… But not quite brand new. Lightly used, perhaps?

The helmet connected to the TCS-4 suit and powered on, a simple HUD flickering to life. The suit ran an automatic self-diagnostic and came back green across the board. Finally some tech that works…

I grab the pistol and magazines and slap them on my left thigh, the magnetic holster automatically kicking in and securing it to my hamstring. The HUD registered the weapon and gave me an ammo count as I attached the magazines to my waist in a similar fashion. 

Damn technology… You don’t realize how much you rely on it. Not even when you lose it; but when you get it back after having lost it. 

I exit the restroom, and open the menu on the HUD of the StoneSkin suit. It’s functionality is limited as it isn’t connected to a MobiGlas. But it did have basic health readouts, environmental sensors, diagnostic capabilities, weapon readouts, and a local map of Ruin Station. Which is nice… Not much beyond that though. Most space suits will connect to a user’s MobiGlas to provide long distance navigation, monetary services, communications, etcetera. 

I use the local map, displayed in the top corner of my HUD to guide me back to the hangar where the Mustang was kept. 

I reach the hangar and am relieved to see it’s exactly how I left it. Except… The door to the freight elevator was open. 
Great… The package is here…
