PART 3 OF X**

“What’s got me so worked up?” I repeat back to the voice behind me, slowly turning to face her.
“Yeah, boy, why you out here throwin’ shit?” the woman responds. I turn to see her, holding a shotgun. Tall, thin,probably mid 40’s, wearing a dirty Stoneskin undersuit with some hastily welded and reinforced dark olive green armor plating. 
She held the shotgun in a ready position, not pointing it at me, but obviously ready to put a stop to any trouble that may have been transpiring in here.

“I… Uhh… I’m stuck. Far away from home… I need a Mobi. I need to get out of here.” I say, my eyes locked to the shotgun, reminding me of how vulnerable I am out here.

“I see…” The woman says with a smirk on her face. “You lookin’ to work… for said Mobi?” she says, her country accent thickly covering over every word. 
“That’d depend on the work…” I replied. Noting the flecks of blood scattered thinly across her platinum blonde hair. 

“I have a lil package that needs to find its way to a gentleman on the other side of this station. I’d take it myself, but the area is filled with ninetails… and they don’ like me much.” she said. She pauses for a moment and squints, looking closely at my face. I knew exactly what words would come out of her mouth next. 

“And… I guess they would’n like you much either in those parts, huh? That’s a nice price tag on your face there.” She says, her smirk becoming a little more malicious.
“That’s from a long time ago. I’m not affiliated with them anymore.” I respond, really missing my helmet about now. “I see… And have heard that before from many like yaself. Hmm, let me see if I have any other jobs that need doin’.” she says as she opens her own Mobi. 

I swear if this bitch wasn’t holding a BR-2 at the ready I’d just take her Mobi and get the hell out of here. “Well… I don’t have anything that involves *not* going into Nine-T territory. Maybe you could find some sort of face covering and do it anyway?” she says, her tone mixed with legitimate intrigue and optimism. “I’m not going anywhere near those fucks.” I respond sharply. Her eyes widen momentarily and then narrow. “Alright… Fine… Guess you don’t need that Mobi *that* badly…” she spits as she turns to leave. 

This bitch… She doesn’t understand my history with them and I don’t care too much to explain it to her. Oh well. 

I watch her turn and face the outside, my eyes pinning on her arms, and how she’s holding the shotgun. I evaluate if I have any potential chance of being able to take her down without getting my brains blown out. 
“You don’t.” She said, not moving a muscle. 
“W-what?” I say, caught off guard, as if she was responding directly to my thoughts. 
“You can’t take me. So don’t even try it. I’ve seen enough of your type here to know exactly how you think.” She says. 

I don’t even bother replying, as it probably wouldn’t help my case here anyways. Fine. Whatever. 

She turns and leaves the room. I’m alone once more, me and my thoughts. I wonder how Cassie is doing… She would have been expecting my return by now. Have they started to search for me? I know my distress call was sent, but who’s to say if there was anything left of my ship by the time they reached the location of the distress call. That merc saved my life I guess, and I still have no clue why. 

Maybe if I make my way to the… Hang on… I have an idea…

I hop my way out of the door to the hospital room, and find the mystery lady walking away from the room towards the main lobby. “Hey! Wait!” I shouted to her.
She stops and stands still for a moment, then turning her head slightly to see me out of the corner of her eye. 
“Yes hun?” She says.
“I think I have an idea as to how I can help you.”
“And how’s that?”
“Are there any abandoned ships here?”
“Of course hun. Tons. Good luck finding one in working order or with key codes that function though.”
“Well… What if I could get a ship running, and then could deliver your packages to your client, *without* trudging through a couple kilometers of NineTails?” I propose. 
The lady stood and thought for a moment, her eyes darting around as if they were flipping through Mobi Contact lens HUD menus. 

“Hmm… Yeah. Maybe. You handy like that?” she asks.
“I’ve been known to have a way with machines… sometimes.” I reply.
“Okay… See if you can get down to deck E, hangar 33. Some long dead merc left an old Mustang Delta there. It was impounded after being parked without payin’ the hangar fee, so Xenothreat decided to sell it to me. I been paying the hangar rent on it just in case anyone came around with the time and skill to get it runnin’ again.” She said.

“What’s wrong with it?” I ask.
“Well… the long dead merc lost a fight. He was long n’ dead when a salvage crew found n’ towed his ship here, lookin for a payday. When XT refused to pay anything for a bullet riddled merc ship, the crew just left it.”
“I see… I’ll see what I can do.” I reply.
“And… Since we’re working together… what’s your name?” I ask.
“You can call me Miss S.” she says. 
“Misses?”
“Miss…S…”
“Ah… alright. Miss….S…” I say, somewhat confused by the specification. 
“You get that ship runnin, and that package delivered to my client, I’ll pay you enough to buy five Mobi’s… the package will be sent up the freight elevator.” She assures.
Five Mobi’s…? For a short range transport? What the hell am I delivering…?
“The Mustang Delta doesn’t have much room for cargo… Some empty space behind the pilot seat, but considering the ship doesn’t even have artificial gravity, it’s going to have to be small and light.” I question Miss S.

“Don’t you worry. The package is small… You’ll work it out. Payment upon completion, meet me at Neutrality when done.” She says ,turning to leave before I can ask any further questions. 

God I’d sworn I was done with smuggling. Is it really smuggling if it’s in Pyro…?
Is anything even illegal here?
I knew the answer to that question. And I didn’t like the implications it might have on what exactly I’m supposed to be transporting.
