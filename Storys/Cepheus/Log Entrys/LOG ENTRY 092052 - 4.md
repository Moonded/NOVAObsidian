PART 4 OF X**

About three hours of tinkering slogged by. The hangar had a small workshop in it, presumably set up by the last poor guy who tried to get this junk Mustang Delta up and running. It at least had enough tools that I could get my bearings inside this wreck. This thing was nearly salvage. 
The plasma compression manifolds for both engines had been riddled with bullets. The ionic exchange manifolds had been all but totally melted, as if the damn pilot of this thing had overclocked his boost capacitor way too much. Don’t even get me started on the armor plating and the canopy. You’d be better off protecting yourself with a piece of swiss cheese. At least the piping to all but two of the maneuvering thrusters was reasonably intact, and the battery of the ship was in reasonable condition.

I managed to get the master power switch to turn on, which lit up the dashboard, which had most of it working. I was able to get a diagnostic through, which of course returned more error and fault codes than I could be bothered to read. I just need to get this thing running well enough to get me through a few kilometers of vacuum with an illicit package, and then back to this hangar, alive. It shouldn’t need to fight, or quantum jump, or speed through atmosphere at mach four. 

I ran a pressure test on all the thrusters, and after my multiple hours of work on the main engines, they were reading both running positively at about 37% efficiency and 60% rated thrust capacity. Which should be good *enough*. The maneuvering thrusters were slow to respond, but functioned well enough, except a couple. I can patch those though.
The transponder didn't work, although it wasn't exactly clear if it’s inoperability was due to combat or the previous owner. Either way, I wouldn’t likely need it here, for this mission. I need this mission to be successful to get me enough cash to buy a MobiGlas, then I should be able to figure out from there how to get out of this damn system and back to Stanton. Back to NOVA. Back to Cassie…
My thoughts lingered on Cass for a few moments, taking my attention away from the task at hand. Before I’d even realized I’d been daydreaming while wrenching on one of the lower maneuvering thrusters, I heard a cough across the hangar. 

I snap back into the present and my head swivels over towards the noise. I see the Merc from before, in that damn Artimex armor. It’s like my own ghost is haunting me I swear. 

“You ran off before I could properly talk to you…” He said, the modulated voice grating against my ears. I used to like the way that it sounded with my own voice. Now it’s just making me cringe. 
“Yeah. You had nothing to offer me… So I left to help myself.” I replied, turning back to the thruster helium input pipe I was patching. 

“Well, I did want to help you. I am not your enemy, you see? I want to see you get home as much as you do.” He says, his posture relaxed. “I seriously doubt that.” I reply apathetically. 
“Well, I know if you are going to be taking this… ship… anywhere, you are going to want a suit that’s properly vacuum rated, no?” he says. I know he probably isn’t intentionally mocking me… But God damn if this guy wasn't armed to the teeth I would have planted my fist in his face already. 

“Yep. You actually gonna help with that?” I say, my patching tool crackling as it finishes sealing up the thruster piping. 
“I can.” He says. Well, I’ve heard that shit before. That means *I can*, but at a cost.
“What do you want for it?” I say. I know I need a vacuum suit, since this Mustang will never be vac rated again. 
“A favor… For later.” He replies smoothly. 
Fuck. That.
“No, fuck you. Get out of my hangar.”
“I’d watch yourself. I don’t think you want to burn your bridge with me. Friends are everything in a place like this.” He replies, still calm as can be. It creeped me out to be honest, and it takes a lot to creep me out.

I paused for a moment, considering my options. I don’t really have any… No money, no Mobi, the one piece of work I’m likely to get that I have a remote chance of surviving *requires* a vacuum rated space suit, and preferably some handheld weapons too. 

“Ugh… Fine. But your ‘favor’ better not be anything ridiculous or you won’t see the other side of it.” I say, trying to sound threatening. The truth was I had nothing to leverage that threat against. I’m hoping he'll take me seriously however… just after the words had left my mouth I determined it may have been a misstep.
“Oh I’ll see the other side of it.” he says, his visor flickering red for a tick.
“Give this to the clerk at the shop called Grim’s Grams. They usually sell drugs, but they have some other wares too. He owes me a favor, and this here,” He tosses me a coin. “This will get you an undersuit, maybe some armor and a pistol too. Enough to complete your mission here.” he says.

I catch the coin, and look at it. It’s an old currency piece from the UPE era…
Back in Stanton this would probably be worth a good five thousand UEC… But here, well… Who knows. They probably don’t have much value for history on Ruin Station.

“Thanks…”I say to him, looking towards the floor. I realize I did threaten this guy after he saved my life, *and* helped me multiple times… 
He stands there still like a statue… Not even his breath swaying his stance.
 
“Try being more kind to those who help you, even if they aren't inside your circle.” he says, relaxing his stance a little. “Well, I’m not among the ‘kind’ type of person here… So my guard is up. Plus I’m out of my element.” I reply, realizing this is a shitty defense. Man he really has me on the back foot doesn't he?
“Uncomfortable without your tech and toys?” He replies. I could almost feel the smile underneath that Artimex.
A smirk finds its way onto my face before I have a chance to stop it. 

The Merc’s MobiGlas beeps, and he pulls it up to look at it.
“Got to go. Take that coin to Grim’s Grams, take what you need, get this junk flying, and come back to me when you have a Mobi. I’ll see what I can do to get you out of here.” He says, turning and walking away at a brisk pace before I have a chance to say anything back. 

I put the UPE coin in the one pocket on my undersuit without a hole in it, and turn my attention back to the thruster I was working on before the Merc came in. Let me get this thing flyable, and then… it’s off to ‘Grim’s Grams’...? What kind of a name is… Eh whatever.
