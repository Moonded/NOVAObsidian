The most beautiful scene I’ve ever laid my eyes upon, right in front of me.

Cassie, standing on our balcony in the habitation area on Orison. Silhouetted by the brilliant red and pink sunrise on the gas giant Crusader. She leaned over the railing, wind gently pushing her dirty blonde hair around. I lay in a reclining chair, a cup of coffee in my hand, soaking in the sights.

  

It took me a few days to settle down once I returned here. Too long out on missions can do that. I sent my ship to Italina to see if she had any magic to work.

So now I just get to relax. Archangel is chasing down leads I’m sure. Or watching after his kid, I dunno.

  

I take a sip of my coffee as Cass turns around to face me. Her almost sparkling, perfect face gains a smile as she meets my eyes. Tank top and shorts, I can hardly contain myself… Ehh.. Maybe not for this log though huh?

  

A couple hours later after some quality time with Cass, I sit in my office chair and turn on my computer. It’s nice to write stuff down with a keyboard instead of through the voice input on my Mobiglas. So I can sit and write this log…. Huh… Meta.

  

Last night I had a nightmare. More of a memory I guess. I need to put my thoughts down somewhere so here we are. I suppose it’s about time I told this story to someone who still breathes. Even if “someone” is some distant NOVA archive I know this gets sent to.

  

BEGIN SCENE

Year: 2950

Location: Ruin Station, Pyro

  

I sat in the bar in Ruin Station. Trying to hide the fact I'm barely 21 with a shitty beard and rough-n-tough facial expressions, It was the latest in a series of repetitive realizations that I’m playing with the big boys. Potentially even in over my head.

  

I was awaiting a meeting with a pirate named Borlathar. This guy was a NineTails Lieutenant. Tough stuff. He had contracted me to deliver a box of… Illicit items, to a client in Stanton. You know I hadn't always been a do-gooder at NOVA. I have a past, like everyone else. Maybe a past I’m none too proud of.

  

Anyways, after what felt like a lifetime of waiting, Borlathar approached the table I was seated at and sat down with a heavy THUNK. Easily 6ft 6in tall, and wearing a modified set of heavy Defiance armor, this guy wasn't someone you wanted to double cross. Unfortunately, the package he had contracted me to deliver… got lost.

It wasn’t my fault, see. The cops had stopped my ship and I had to eject it out of the cargo bay, then creatively maneuvering my ship while “stopping” to put the box right in my drive plume, incinerating it so there was nothing to find for the UEE.

  

Finding nothing, the cops let me go, but unfortunately I was now left without a box of goods. I had reported this to Borlathar, hoping he would see my forthcomingness as a sign of good will and assume I didn't in fact steal the box. They had said something about its contents being worth over a half mil of UEC. As evidenced by the hearty pay this job was giving me.

  

I had worked with Borlathar a few times in the past, and I hope he had some trust for me. I guess we’d see.

  

“So…” Borlathar started with a heavy, gravely voice. “Care to tell me how a box of my most valuable items for my highest paying client just happens to go missing, Cepheus?” he growls at me. “Well, I unfortunately got caught in a UEE stop zone on my way to Hurston. I had no choice to stop or they would pursue me. Hurston isn't exactly a great place to run from the cops, considering their security forces they have there.”

I said. I explained how I had to incinerate the box to keep the cops from scanning me, identifying it, and giving me a crimestat.

  

“Crimestats are removable in Stanton, Cepheus. You of all people should know this. I thought I could count on you.” Bor said, his voice raising. “You can, this was a one time thing. The cops had me two ways past Sunday man. They had a couple M50s ready if I tried to run, and a fully gunned Redeemer doing the scanning. It was almost as if they were waiting for me. I know they weren't, but still.” I said, trying to build my defense.

  

“I see. So you plan to compensate me for what I lost?” Bor said, his statement obviously not intended as a question. Truth was, I had nowhere near the amount of money that box was worth. Maybe he would give me time to get it, or maybe he’d just cut off my arm. Or head.

“I would love to… But I’m a little short on that kind of cash at the moment. Can I start a payment plan?” I said, trying to add an inflection of humor. When in a good mood, Bor was typically reasonably agreeable and would respond well to said humor. Unfortunately he was not in a good mood. Stupid move.

“Is that so?” Bor said, now very visibly angry. He reached and grabbed my wrist, while simultaneously pulling out a Demon Fang knife with his right hand, setting the knife on the table, still in hand, and maintaining a power armor assisted iron grip on my right wrist.

  

So if I’m lucky he’ll take a couple fingers and let me pay him back in the VERY NEAR future… Yeah, I’m definitely in over my head.

“Yeah, man, see, I just need a couple weeks, and I’ll get you your money. How much was it again?” I said, trying to not show my panic in my voice.

“Let's see…” Bor moved his left arm up, to show his Mobiglas, maintaining his grip on my wrist with said arm, twisting my wrist something painful. His Mobi lit up. “Seven hundred and thirty one thousand, six hundred fifty United Earth Credits.” he said.

  

I remembered having checked my bank account this morning, something to the tune of two hundred thousand credits. Great. Less than a third.

“And the last I checked, you had less than a third of that amount in your account.” Bor said. This guy can see my bank account? I guess I should have guessed for the Ninetails… This is getting worse.

Borlathar sat silent for a moment, my hand now going numb from the grip on my wrist.

  

“Take off your helmet.” He said to me, his voice now shockingly calm.

This was bad.

He released my wrist and I knew I had no choice but to reach up, hit the release button at the base of my Stoneskin Helmet, pop the seal, and pull it off my head.

  

I set it down on the table, and at the same moment Borlathar was removing his own helmet. Showing a very heavy set face, square jaw, salt and pepper crew cut hair, and a multitude of long scars across his face. This was really bad.

  

He glanced up at his bodyguards and made an almost imperceptible grunt. They instantly began to move towards me, circled behind me, and grabbed me by the arms and neck. Shit.

With his bodyguards holding me still, Borlathar looked me square in the eye as he pressed a button on his knife, then it’s double edges started to glow red hot.

  

Without another word, he stood up, moved the whole table to the side, effortlessly, and then stepped to me and grabbed my face.

He put the knife to my cheek, and said quietly, calmly, “You have 24 hours to get me my money, or I’ll remove your skin, slowly, intimately, while you still breathe. Then I’ll put you in a med tank, and keep you as a trophy.” He then dug the tip of the knife into my right cheek, its burning blades causing a searing pain. He suddenly jerked the knife downwards, leaving a big, charred, gaping wound down my face. There was no blood, due to the cauterization, but there was a strong smell of burning flesh, which made Borlathar smile as he smelled it, it seemed to me.

  

He stood there for a moment as I gasped in pain, taking in the power he had just wrenched over me. He then spit on my face, told his guards to let me go, and then they threw me on the ground violently. I don't remember much after that.

  

I then woke up in the present, covered in a cold sweat, Cassie at my side holding me tightly, a look of stark worry on her face. Her eyes were pained, as if she knew what I had just witnessed in my dream.

  

Sadly this wasn't a dream, but a fact of my past. The face wound got infected, and spread, leaving one nasty scar along the right side of my face. Sadly Ruin station didn't have much medical care, not that I could afford it anyways at that point. Borlathar had drained my bank account, and sent me a message demanding the remaining 510,586UEC within 24 hours or he would do the unmentionables he had threatened me with before.

  

That was the day I realized I wasn’t invincible. That was the first day of the rest of my life, the day I figured out I had to do something else. The day I decided to go on the right side of the law.

  

END SCENE

I have that nightmare every week at least. My biggest failure still haunts me. The failure isn't even the loss of that package, but the series of decisions I had made that got me in that whole scenario to begin with.

  

I still wear only closed faced helmets, I refuse to show my face to people outside my inner circle. I tell them it’s because of my criminal past, and threats made to my family. While that did happen, and I’m not exactly lying, the real reason is that I can’t stand to show people that I let myself go that far down that path. The Demon Fang knife leaves very unique scars, and anyone in the know enough to recognize it, is most likely going to get a very low opinion of me very quickly.

  

I'm better than my scars. Maybe one day I’ll believe that enough to wear open face helmets again. Who knows.
