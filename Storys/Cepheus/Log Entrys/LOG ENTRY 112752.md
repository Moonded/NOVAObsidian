SHIP: N/A
LOCATION: N/A?**

I stood alone in the darkness of Hangar 13, all but the floor directly underneath my feet and the void of space through the open hangar door was invisible to me. The air shields across the hangar door kept the room pressurized. 

Distant echoes from creaking structural beams and ship traffic rang through the vast, dark, open and empty space of the ruined hangar.
I stood alone wearing my old Artimex suit from the Orphanage Raid, the visor display trying to see through the impenetrable inky black darkness. I tried to switch to night vision mode but the software functionality didn’t seem to work… or exist. 

A ping on my suit’s integrated sound radar lit up behind me. I spun around to face the new threat, raising the S-38 pistol I held in my hands to bear. While no threat was visible through my helmet display, I could feel as if someone was there. “Show yourself!” I yelled through my helmet’s loudspeaker. 

“Oh, ho Cephy boy. You really think you could get rid of me that easily?” A booming deep voice called back from the darkness. 
I desperately kept trying to flip through my helmet’s vision modes to identify the voice, but nothing was working properly. All the status lights read green, but it was as if I’d never programmed the functions in the first place. 

“Do you still remember?” the voice called, now to my left. I turned on my heels to face the sound, pistol raised. “Remember what?!” I yelled back, attempting to cover my fear with anger. 

“Remember who you’re running from. Who you used to be before they called you Cepheus?” The voice spoke to my left again. 

I spun to the left again, pistol ready at arms length when the barrel impacted a solid metal object.
Not an object… Armor. A sharp *CLANG* reverberated throughout my suit and body, a sharp pain radiating from the back of my left hand, the pistol leaving my grip from the sudden impact.
At that moment, a red angular visor lit up the darkness. Somehow bright enough to cast a red light across the entire hangar. 

A nearly 3 meter tall figure stood before me, clad in crimson red Artimex armor. Or maybe that was just the light…

With a bone jolting *WHAM* I was thrown across the hangar onto my back, sliding a meter or two before coming to a painful halt. My HUD’s status light showed amber cautions across much of my suit. I felt pins and needles across my hands and feet.

The menacing and gigantic figure moved towards me. Not walking… Almost… Levitating. 
“You must have forgotten… Poor child. Let me remind you.” The figure said, its voice now becoming familiar to my ears. 

The figure withdrew a large sledge hammer from its back mag mount, holding it within its massive hands. 
I tried my best to get off my back and onto my feet, but my suit felt heavier than it ever had before. I was paralyzed. I couldn't move no matter how hard I tried. 

The figure raised its hammer. “You have run for many years. For that you should be proud.” It stated, its Artimex visor glowing brighter red as the sledge hammer went over its head. 

“But you left debts unsettled, hatches unburied, and strings untied…. For that, you will pay.”
The hammer raised further still, nearly touching the top of the hangar it seemed from my perspective.

The visor shifted from red to purple. 

The sledge hammer began to fall. Not moving relative to my view, but becoming larger. 
And larger.

And larger.

“Wake up Seth.”
“NOOOOOOO!!” 
—--------------------------
“WAKE UP CEPH!” Cassie yelled as she shook me in our bed. 
I gasped and opened my eyes, my throat sore and as dry as cotton. 
My blurry vision came into focus on Cassie, tears streaming down her face. “I’ve been trying to wake you for like half an hour!” She said as she held me tightly. I was covered in a cold sweat, my side of our bed drenched. 
“Ugh, I’m sorry.” I say, sighing from exhaustion. I glanced over at the clock by our bedside. 0417 Local time. Man I’ve woken up Cassie in the early hours again with this shit. 
“No no honey, don’t apologize.” She said as she laid her head on me. “I can’t keep doing this to you.” I say. “It’s fine, really. Considering what you’ve been through I am honestly surprised it doesn’t happen more.” “It’s nearly every night…” “And that’s fine.”
I look up at the ceiling, the distant lights of the Orison platforms scattering through our bedroom window and reflecting off it. 
“I’m going to go get a drink.” I say softly, gently moving Cassie’s arm off of my chest. She hums in agreement and I then stand up and walk out of the bedroom. Dim pink lights cast through our apartment provide enough night lighting to navigate the space without disturbing night vision. I make my way to the kitchen and grab a cup from the cabinet. I put it in the drink side of our fridge door, pushing the fridge’s buttons in order to dictate that it dispenses a cup full of cold water. 

As I wait and watch the clear liquid pour into the cup, I hear my MobiGlas chime from the Bedroom. The cup fills quickly and I grab it, taking a sip and enjoying how it felt going down my dry throat. 

I make my way back to the bedroom and Cassie, now half asleep again, groggily says “I think you got a message…” “Thanks babe.” I reply, running my hand through her hair as her eyes close. 
I pick up the MobiGlas and secure it around my wrist. I activate its holographic display and a new message populates the screen.

   ShaRroos: Hey Cepheus I have some good news and some great news and some … you know QUENCH IT! This is awesome! Okay I have developed a new cladding process that imbeds EM Dampening into the HULL. It involves Graphene wire mesh, and explosions! Good news, this dampening is always on. Bad news, it is always on. Since this is part of the hull you can't just decide to stop dodging incoming EM. However, that is fine as it is registered to the same numbered company that "Point of No Return" was registered under. As well, she has similar licenses. You know that the Helios system can be dangerous for unshielded ships.

   Using the lessons I learned from your previous ship I was able to integrate SEVERAL of the benefits you have grown to enjoy. So to get in the weeds a little if you take a stock Ship of this class you will gain around a boost of 20% SCM speed and 30% Max speed. I am a racer shop so most of your turn axes are boosted around 40%. I was even able to reduce your thermal bloom by around 40% and drastically dumped Electromagnetic emissions to the tune of 50%. I tweaked your shield generation to add a little more protection there. Sadly the hull, while brilliant, is a little weaker. Also that fancy new cladding will require a touch up from time to time. 

So yea there you go ”From The Ashes” is registered and ready for pickup when you are ready. She is gorgeous, I am going to hate to see her leave the hangar.

As my eyes scan the message thoroughly, a small swell of excitement starts to cover the terror from the night. It might be time to get back to business…

I composed a quick reply to ShaRroos.

Cepheus: Hey ShaRroos! Thanks for the update… I do appreciate the update! I will be there in approximately six hours to pick up the ship, initial payment in hand. As I think I had mentioned before, albeit some time ago now, I would like for the Avionics and Flight Control server panels to be open or unlocked for the time being. Also, could you leave the data link system powered on, channel 337.00? With AIFCS enabled. Just want to try out some tech I’ve been working on. It’s fine if it’s powered off though, just batteries online as usual for storage. Thanks, see you soon!
