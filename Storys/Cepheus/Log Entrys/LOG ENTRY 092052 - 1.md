PART 1 OF X

Faint noises and blurry lights surround me. My head is pounding unbearably, my extremities are tingling, my eyelids extraordinarily heavy. 

I fade in and out of consciousness for what feels like hours. Days, perhaps? I wake up for a few seconds, feel instantly nauseous, I try to sit up to puke but my body won't move. Before I am able to lift my head up I return back to the inky darkness.

Finally I see light. Bright, harsh, cold light. I’m freezing cold. Did I regenerate? No… This isn’t how it was described to feel like… I must have been out for a long time. My entire body aches. I open my eyes, everything is still blurry. I see colors fading in. Rusty looking walls… A messy floor… A humanoid figure standing in the corner…
The blur begins to resolve into a clearer image. The air tastes stale… Oily. 

The figure sharpens into what appears to be some back alley doctor, in torn up scrubs and wearing a strange insignia I don’t immediately recognize.

“Ah, you’re awake. For a while there I didn’t think you would.” The man said. He had dark skin, buzzed, tight curly hair, and a clean shaven face. His dark brown eyes stared at me like I was some kind of anomaly. “Where am… I…?” I mutter, my throat so dry it feels like the deserts of Hurston. “You are in Ruin Station. Neutrality Bar Hospital. An armored gentleman dropped you off under our ‘No questions asked’ policy, and left. Said something about wanting to speak with you when you woke up.” the man explained.

Ruin… Station…? No. No no no no… Fuck! I need to get out of here. Get back to Stanton…. No ship… Shit…. This is *NOT* good. My arms feel like they’re covered in cement as I try to move them, stiff… heavy… “Why can’t I move my arms…?” I ask weakly, trying my best to command my muscles to move. “You have been unconscious here for… Three weeks… I believe. You had some serious nerve and brain damage due to oxygen deprivation, and interruptions in your suit’s survival mode systems. But we were able to correct most of that… Thankfully your benefactor dumped you at the best hospital in Pyro.” The man said, a smirk forming on his face.
“Which doesn’t come free…” I said under my breath. I remember how these places work. You can be dropped off at the door of a hospital and they’ll let you just bleed out if you don’t have the scrip to pay for it. Everything is for profit. 

“No, it doesn’t.” The man replied. “However, lucky for you, your benefactor paid for your treatment.” A small wash of relief went over me. 
Who… was this benefactor? Who found me… and brought me *here*? 

After a few seconds of tiring determination, I finally managed to lift my left arm off the med bed, looking down to see I was wearing nothing but the hospital gown. My eyes move to my wrist, where no MobiGlas is to be found.
“Wh…Where is my stuff?!” I said, my dry throat causing my words to hang and come out scratchy. 

“Well… Your benefactor paid for your *treatment*... He did not pay for your security. Our resources are limited here… So I can’t say who has been in your room during the many times I have not been able to directly watch over you.” The man said. 

Fuuuck… All of my stuff is gone. Stolen, in damn RUIN STATION! This is going to be a tough situation to get out of…

“Can you at least give me a space suit? Something vacuum capable, at least?” I asked the man, a hint of pleading undertoning my voice. 

“Yeah… Sure. There’s a couple spare suits in the lower left drawer over there. I need to go attend to other patients, if you can’t move within the next few hours… Just hang on and I’ll be back tomorrow.” The man said, turning to leave. *Tomorrow?!*. This place sucks. 

Before I could refute, the man left the small dank room. This was the worst hospital room I’d ever seen. Makes Grim Hex’s hospital look like Orison General… 
Trash all over the floor… Drawers half open. If sterilization fields hadn’t become so ubiquitous and cheap, I’d bet you’d get an infection just existing in this room for a few minutes.
A few long, painful minutes of struggling later, I finally manage to force the blood to flow through my extremities once again, slowly dragging myself up and out of the medbed. Before I had gotten up, I read the display screen on the medbed, and it read all good… for the most part. It appeared I had a spinal fracture, which had been fused back together before I arrived. I had received some treatment before I got here… Hmm.

One mystery at a time I guess.

I stand up and take off the grimey medical gown, opening the drawer the man…Doctor?... Person had pointed to before. In it was a stitched up, hastily glued together space suit which strongly resembled the “Why Not?” novelty spacesuit series you can buy at places like Grim Hex. I did say *vacuum* capable… didn’t I?
I guess it’s better than being naked.

The suit at least feels reasonably clean, albeit very haphazard in its construction.

I put the suit on, and grab the helmet also in the drawer. Its faceplate was cracked a bit, with some tape put over it. However it had a fully unobscured clear visor, so… so much for facial anonymity. I could *really* have used that here… Oh well… Adapt… Improvise… Over..come? Some weird phrase the NOVA Marine admiral liked to say. 

I turn the helmet over and look inside it, there’s some weird green residue inside… I put my head up to it and take a sniff… It’s absolutely wretched. Almost made me puke instantly… Jesus did someone throw up in here, and then they just toss the helmet in and don't bother to clean it?! What the fuck is this place… I’ll find another helmet… I’m **NOT** putting that on my head. 

I toss it back into the drawer with little care, slamming the low drawer shut with my leg. At least the suit works…. Well… “works”.

So that leaves me with another problem. I have no MobiGlas. That means no access to funds, ships, equipment, maps, anything. 

Didn’t that ‘doctor’ say something about my ‘benefactor’ wanting to speak to me?
Maybe I should go find him…
