MISSION CLOCK: 13D, 8H, 6M
N-ID: 615997 - LIEUTENANT/ HEATHENS
CALLSIGN: CEPHEUS
NAME: ERR
SYSTEM: STANTON
SHIP: NSS POINT OF NO RETURN
LOCATION: ARCCORP HIGH ORBIT

  

So as it turns out, Naz’s request for me on his ship was to promote me to Lieutenant of the Heathens. Which was pretty freaking sick! I'm starting to move up I suppose... Naz has me helping out with Heathen operations, and I have to say I'm enjoying myself. There's also whispers I've picked up about a possible promotion to Commander In Training if the LT thing goes well.

  

The folks at the Area 18 hospital are quite nice by the way; The work they do is good. Not cheap, but what can you expect for a corporate planet?

  

A couple days after the operation, just when I’d gotten out of the hospital, I got an encrypted message from Italina, the person who gave me a link with someone who pointed us in the direction of the Orphanage in the first place. I know extremely little about her, we had met in Magnus, and then again in Stanton, where she had convinced me to rescue her sister, in return for some special stealth modifications for my ship. Anyways, the message read as follows:

  

==== Message ====

From: Italina

To : Cepheus

Cepheus, guess you got a little sloppy, the individual in this data package escaped the site before you attacked. Please share with your new friends, this person is more dangerous than the ones you encountered when you helped me. Our mutual acquaintance is currently following him. When we find out where he is headed, I will contact you. Also, I need to know if there were marked pictures at the location, if yes, find a way to get me a copy. === End Message ===

  

I sent a response which read

====Message====

From: Cepheus

To: Italina

Someone escaping before we arrive is me being sloppy? I’d disagree with that notion. We had to take our time with this, speed wasn’t our top priority. Making sure all our people got out alive was. Which they mostly did… The escapee is a problem for another day. I would like to know more about this person however. “Dangerous” is a type we’ve been dealing a lot with lately. I didn't find any pictures at the location, but I also wasn't one of the forensics types who scoured the place once we had finished. I'll inquire with some of my friends, and will let you know if there is anything of note. If the missing individual is located, let me know and I’ll have him taken care of. Is it an elimination type person, or an “acquire and interrogate” type person? ===End Message===

  

I'm still not sure exactly how much I trust her, and I'm damn certain she has some sort of angle here I haven't picked up on. But she’s done good to me in the past, so I might leave some faith there.

  

I had gotten all patched up there, and headed off and for the next couple weeks was doing work with my squadron. Nothing particularly noteworthy for this log.

  

Yesterday though I went with ArchangelCorps and the rest of the Orphanage Assault Squad to a meeting with Bandader, the lead of the Orphanage Op, and he informed us the higher ups in NOVA want Arch and I to keep digging into these people. Our first objective is to secure Malachite, and bring him in for questioning. The guy sold us out after all, and it seems like Arch is out for blood on this one. So I’ve been ordered with to ensure we bring him back alive.

We’ve also been named Task Force Azrael, which is cool.

  

So I’ve hopped back aboard my ship, the 400i The Point Of No Return and parked myself in high Arccorp orbit to do some work on my suit, my ship, and prep for this next mission.

I had to straight up replace my chestpiece, it got too many holes put in it by one of the hostiles during the Orph assault. Everything else was able to be cleaned up and repaired where necessary.

  

I did some minor software tweaks on my helmet. Some intuitive mode switches and targeting information for on foot operations. I didn't see that guy who shot me a bunch, and I should have. So now my helmet should be able to identify targets and outline them in red for me, as long as my brain can keep up.

  

I'm scheduled to meet up with Archangel tomorrow to plan this Malachite retrieval, hopefully we can get a sensible plan worked up.
