I make my way to the freight elevator in hangar 33 to see what my package might be.

I’m relieved and somehow surprised to see it’s a simple 1/8th SCU box. Black, with a faintly pulsing yellow light on the top. 
It was almost comical seeing a full scale freight elevator with a simple tiny box planted in the exact middle. 

I grab it, shake it around a little… A no-no from my old smuggling days. You *don’t want* to know what you’re carrying. But hey… I was curious. 
There was the sound of a shifting large object, but not much could be discerned. The box must be reasonably insulated. 
I hold the box and make my way back to the barely functioning Mustang Delta and deploy the entry ladder and open the canopy. 
I climb the ladder one handed with the package in the other.
I step up on the platform around the pilot seat and lean around the seat, placing the box behind the pilot station. I place it down and hear a faint *click* as the box auto mag-locks itself to the floor of the Delta. 

A fancy feature for a simple box for a quick delivery on a sketchy station in a lawless star system…

I push the concern of the contents of my delivery to the back of my mind and sit in the pilot seat, pushing the button to close the canopy and entry ladder.
I flip the master power switch, bringing the dashboard displays to life. 
They flicker red, then orange. An auto-diagnostic report comes up, reporting all the same faults as before. Sufficient for this job… I hope.
The cockpit pressurization was reporting 0%, though. Which was expected. That package box definitely was air tight, so I wasn’t concerned there. I ran another diagnostic on my suit however… Can never be too sure.

It came back green, all readings at 95% or greater. Perfect.
I flipped on the engine power switch, and pushed the ignition button. The power plant kicked up with the additional load… I heard the helium manifolds whine as the superheated gas began to accelerate through magnetic induction manifolds, accelerating the gas to a very high speed, generating thrust. 

I look closely at the engine instrument monitors. They’re shaky… all over the place… But sufficiently out of the red… for now.
I flip to comms and ping the station ATC computer to open my hangar.
It responds back quickly and the door hisses as the air shield field activates at the hangar door and the massive metal plates begin to slide sideways, revealing the vacuum of space.

I push up on the flight controls, commanding the ship to lift off the ground.
The landing gear creaks as the hydraulic struts are extended for the first time in a long time… the lower maneuvering thrusters being worked harder than they have for what must be years. The entire ship creaks and groans like an old Idris as it slowly lifts off the hangar floor. 
‘**POWER PLANT FLUCTUATIONS**’ flashes in red in the upper HUD. Well, that's not *unexpected*...

I push the throttle forward gently and feel the main engines roar to life and push me slowly out of the hangar.

The controls are mushy and delayed. I can feel the pipes rattle as the maneuvering thrusters can barely handle the superheated plasma being pushed through them.

The IFCS computers were all but totally offline, the diagnostic menu showing an “ALTERNATE LAW” annunciation. This means the control inputs I give are sent to the thrusters raw, unmoderated, unchecked by the ship’s safety handling protocols. The ship’s rotations won’t be automatically arrested. That means every little roll or pitch or yaw I command has to be stopped by me, manually. I’ll also need to be very gentle to make sure I don’t over stress this already stricken ship. The end result of this is probably what looked like the most drunk flying I’ve ever performed. Not that it was likely to look *too* strange to any ATC personnel at *Ruin Station*. 

The Delta’s nav computer had already been loaded with the destination hangar for my mission… a detail I’d not realized until this exact moment. Miss S was really betting on me getting this ship working… wasn’t she?

The hangar was about two klicks from my current location. I wrestle the unstable ship over to the hangar, avoiding the debris and other ships present in the space surrounding Ruin Station. I set the velocity vector marker safely next to the hangar, and pushed the speed about as far as I would trust the ship to reverse when I arrived; about 100 m/s. 

Once the ship was on course and at speed, I tried my best to arrest any rotation and laid back in the seat. It felt good to be in space again, out of that wretched station.

I have a feeling this mission will not be the end of my time here… however…
