    With a sharp ‘trat trat trat’ the ringing of an impact drill fills the shop floor. A worn brown leather jacket shutters as it hangs off the barrel of the underslung repeater. A dull metal ‘clack’ fills the next second as an abandoned bolt rolls out from under the shadow of the small craft. The long swooping nosed hull gives the impression that the craft is already moving. *”breach!”* a soft curse floats in air before a fingerless gloved hand snaps out plucking the bolt from the ground. “I did not custom design you just so you could run away from your home,” a soft voice coos at the offending object. Again the ‘trat trat trat’ of the impact drill comes back before the tool is tossed out from under the craft with a **thud.**
    
    The sound of wheels grinding against concrete split the hanger with the sled crawling out from under the vessel. A purple glow starts to bound off the underside of the green craft as the red haired mechanic sits up on the dolly and pushes the rest of the way from under the sloped nose. With a warm smile and a loving pat, the gloved hand glides over the green hull as she stands. “Okay, that should keep you in fighting form even in that toxic atmosphere of that rust bucket of a planet.” A long sigh rolls from her lips as she starts collecting the tools spread about the small single seat craft. “Only the black and gold would put a junk yard 2km outside their capital city. THEN try and monetize it by putting a race track there!” Snatching the jacket and tossing it over her shoulder the redhead, still wearing a smile of pride, begins walking to her office. 

Her head cants to the right as she walks past the asymmetric ship standing center of her hanger. The red hull glimmering with a rainbow sheen that shimmers and shifts as she walks past it. The dancing patterns from refracted light glide over the surface. “Old school meets the modern era. I sure hope Hayden gets the patent published soon. I get the feeling that this is going to change things.” 

–
A *ding* over the intercom denoted the arrival of a ship at the facility.
Red hair swings as her head turns to face the status screen on the office wall.
“NEW ARRIVAL:
ID: CEPHEUS - NOVA - COMMANDER. PERMIT ACCESS?” Is displayed in bold text.
A swift flick of her Mobiglas’ band sends a “Yes” signal to the display, unlocking the doors for the new arrival.

Just as soon as she’d entered, ShaRroos turns about her heels and exits her office, walking towards the main entrance into the hangar as the doors hissed open. 

Through the threshold into the space walked a red-painted Artimex clad man. The glow from the aggressive fascia of the helmet casting red light across the doorway.

Green eyes glimmer at the armor approaching. With a smile she calls out, “Right on time, Cepheus.” Her stride quickens to a confidant gait to saddle up to the powerfull presence of the customer. 

“So this is it.” He says, his electronically modulated voice reverberating throughout the hangar. 
“Exactly as described, and the work is all completed. You have a 50m/s faster SCM speed, about a G and a half more acceleration, 1300m/s max speed, and your turn axis are a decent bit more responsive too. The hull turned out perfectly, and your ship should only be detectable by average scanners within 500m. High end military scanners… Maybe 2km?” ShaRroos boasted. 
“Batteries on, and panels open, as I’d asked?” Cepheus asks, turning his helmet towards the redhead standing beside him. 

With a nod she hands over a dataslate, clad in the same red shimmering material as the ship’s hull. “As requested. Here is the map to the capacitor locations. As well as the related operating information. Also I’d mention that due to the manufacturing process used for the hull, it does come at the cost of lower strength. I did offset that by hardening the shielding capacitors and tweaking the field overlaps.”

The menacing Artimex helmet nodded in agreement, and stood silently for a moment. 
“Thanks”, the electronic voice spoke, as he turned to face the red gleaming ship in the center of the massive hangar. 

“So why did you wa-” ShaRroos trailed off as Cepheus jogged over to the rear of the ship. The large rear ramp opens with a *hissss*, and extends to just a meter in front of Cepheus’ feet. 

“Hang out here for a minute.” Cepheus states authoritatively, looking over his shoulder briefly before walking up the ramp at a brisk pace. With a smirk and a shrug ShaRroos plants a hand on her hip, waiting for whatever her client had planned.
A few minutes later Cepheus emerges from the cargo hold of the Crusader Datarunner.
He approaches ShaRroos, and then turns to face the ship once again, doing god knows *what* inside that helmet. ShaRroos tilted her head as the ship’s running lights illuminated. The hum of a starting fusion powerplant fills the hangar.

Then each of the ship’s maneuvering thrusters spit a brief puff of plasma as they run through a self-diagnostic test. Cepheus remains staring at the ship, same as prior, unmoving. 

The ship’s lower maneuvering thrusters ignite in a sustained flame, firing plasma downwards. The rapid bloom of the exhaust catches the brown jacket attempting to send its wearer across the hanger. Throwing her shoulder into the wash and tucking her head under her wrist the redhead’s freckled face snaps to her wrist pulling up the holographic interface. As the woman’s boots slide across the clean hanger floor, the armored Cepheus stands against the torrent like an iron clad statue. Calling out to her client “WHAT the **QUENCH** do YOU THINK you’re DOING!” her eyes focus on the display at her wrist, the image of the red ship pulls as she begins to tap on the interface. 

The ship lifts about 5 meters off the ground, does a pirouette without moving laterally at all, raises and then lowers it’s landing gear, and comes to a rest, hovering in front of them. The turrets all spin about their axis, and return to center. Barely over the roar of the wash the furious redhead shouts at her client. “POWER DOWN OR I ….” Her words are cut off a moment later the ship gently sets back down, the engines extinguish, the hum of a fusion powerplant fades, the running lights darken, and the door hisses open. 

“That’ll do.” Cepheus states, boarding the ship. With her client walking up the ramp she smooths out her jacket and lets out a frustrated sigh, closing her display with an overly aggressive slap to the console. As soon as she does a triple chirp brings the display back noting she’d received the agreed upon amount of UEC for the work. Another sigh rolls from her chest as she confirms payment and transfers ownership to the man calmly walking away. The MSR’s rear ramp closes behind Cepheus, and over her comm’s, Cepheus states “Mind opening the hangar door for me?”. “Not a problem, next time you are in the shop I need warning BEFORE any system tests!” She replies over the unceremoniously opened comm channel. The massive hangar doors atop ShaRroos’ facility open, and then the MSR gracefully exits the hangar, blasting off into the distance.
