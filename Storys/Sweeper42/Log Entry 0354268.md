Hey Sis!

Well It finally happened, The system wide automated Asset Wipe. I didn’t think it would happen to me. Of course, I guess no-one ever does. But I thought my Status as a [[NOVA intergalactic]] pilot would make me exempt. There’s going to be hell to pay once High Command hear about this...

I guess I should explain a little. Stanton has been having some problems with the locals. and there’s a growing conspiracy theory that to keep the civs in-line [[Hurston dynamics]] occasionally sends out a system wide asset wipe... Meaning everyone’s assets get automatically ceased by the corporation...

Fortunately I was one of the lucky ones... at least I got to sleep through the night, mobi net is full of horror stories of people getting pulled from their beds late in the night and kicked out on the streets after their houses had been ceased.. and others getting arrested for theft coming into stations with ships they no-longer own...

Don’t worry about me though, I’m in contact with [[NOVA HQ|HQ]], they’re working on keeping us all covered until the jump points re-open and we can get out of this system. I didn’t think this tour would be as long as it is.. Just glad the communications relays are working still...

Anyways got to go. I’m sure you’ve heard by now but the [[Ninetales]] gang have launched an attack on orison and the Nova fleet has been called in to offer assistance. Maybe if you watch the mobi-net you’ll see me!,

Stay safe!
