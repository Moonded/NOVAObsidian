My hangar is pretty cramped thanks to not one ship, but three occupying space in it. Right below the main Hangar doors stands my corsair, as I use it the most lately and there isn’t much space left where I could stow her. The small side bays where filled with my Avenger Stalker and my Cutlass Red which barely fitted into the small space. I was lucky to get a hangar big enough for my ships, as I don’t think I would have space for more ships. As I knew that Lis would be coming today I prepared the ships yesterday for a short tour and to show her around.

I was checking the engines of the „Slave 5“ once again as Lis stepped into the hangar. She looked around the hangar first, before her eyes settled on my corsair. 
„Oh wow, you didn’t say you got a Drake Corsair in here, I never was aboard one, but I always wanted to.“
„Well, you not only will be able to go on board of it and see every detail of it, you might even be able to fly her one day.“ I responded as I walked up to her. 
„Welcome to my hangar, as you can see it is pretty cramped, but all has its place in here. As you already recognized my biggest ship is a corsair, her name is „Slave 5“. Over there in the medium bay we have my cutlass red, which I use for some S&R missions and in the small bay is my avenger stalker for bounty hunting and prisoner transport. I’m gonna show you around and after that we can discuss the last details of our arrangement. “ We took a tour of the smaller ships first, but I could see that she was eager to get her hands on the corsair. 

We entered from the back ramp into the cargo hold and then continued to the engine room in the middle of the ship. 
„This would be your main working area, as you can see most of the components are accessible from this room or are installed in the cargo hold. There is also a console in here from which the systems of the ship can be observed.“ She looked around the room with sparkling eyes and I could see, that she was really interested in the place. 
„And you can control and observe all the ship systems from that one console there? Thats great, makes managing it a lot easier.“
I showed her the docking room with the armory and further upfront the mess hall and crew quarters. „It might not be the most luxury place, but we have everything here to survive out in the verse and make the best out of it. When we go out on a mission you of course get one of the rooms here and you get free hand in decorating or styling it to your liking.“
At last we came to the cockpit in the front. „And here is where most of the magic happens. Whenever you aren’t busy back there you are welcome to join me here on the bridge or going down into the copilot seat. I hope you enjoyed the small tour and we will go back to the mess hall to speak about the future.“

After we sat down on the table I asked her if she had any further questions. „Yes, I understand that right, that my job here will be to maintain the ships while they are in the hangar and come with you on a mission, where I do my best to keep the ship running under all kinds of conditions?“ 
„That's right. It may seem boring at first, but you won’t be alone with the upkeeping. I will help as much as I can, if I get time. And just for your understanding it might be my ship, but I would like that we treat each other as equals, so whenever you have some suggestions or things that you wanna speak about, just tell me and we will speak about it. In terms of mechanics I think you know a lot more than me. Only time when I will be your boss is when we are in combat, because that's not the time for discussions.“
„Alright, understood Captain.“ She said with a roguish undertone and I had to smile.
„Good that we understand each other. That would be it for today, If you want you can look around the hangar and the ships some more you of course can, the hangar is open for you all the time. If you have any questions I will be at the small office here in the hangar and will also send you a contract with all the details to your mobi. I’m looking forward working together with you. I would like to make a trip tomorrow with you to show you what the „Slave 5“ can and how it is to fly with her, so please be here tomorrow morning. “
I left the corsair together with Lis and she left the hangar, after reassuring that she will be there tomorrow. I went to my office, finalized the contract and opened a map of the stanton system to see where our trip will take us.
