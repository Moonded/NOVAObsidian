Part 4/4

I was working on my report as I heard how my captive began to wake up. I closed the report and once again started the recording on my helmet, so I would at least have something to show if anything goes wrong.

He seemed to be a bit disoriented as he first looked around the room, but seemed to shortly remember where he was when he looked in my direction. “Alright my friend, if you're gonna be cooperative we might find an arrangement so both of us can go out of here nearly unharmed.” I said to him, “Oh, you don’t seem to understand with whom you are dealing here. I’m already dead.” “Well, if you are dead anyway, you might be able to answer some questions.” I showed him the encrypted data I found with the coordinates on it. “I found this while investigating a different case and was interested about the proximity to The Orphanage. But neither official reports nor NOVA reports could help me find out what it is, so I came here to investigate on my own. Can you tell me if this was only a ‘medical facility’ or something more?” “You still don't seem to understand. I won’t answer your questions, but thank you for providing us with some answers about you and your knowledge, Fives.” With those words he activated some kind of device in his suit that seemed to electrocute him. 

For the next few minutes I was perplexed about how fast he killed himself. And what did he mean that I provided them with information about myself and how the heck did he knew my name? Those were some serious questions I needed answers to, but not now. I made pictures and scans of the armor sets, but I didn’t dare to take one with me. I didn’t know what tech they might have installed in them. Maybe even some sort of tracking device and that was the least thing I needed at the moment. The scans showed that both men had some sort of capsule in their teeth which triggered some sort of reaction inside his suit. With the scans I might be able to recreate one of the suits, but that's all I would do at the moment. 

I went to the command module one last time to see if I could get any useful data, but it seemed that they always wiped their navigation computers before they leave the ship. So no new information here. Disappointed, I carefully left the ship and made my way back to the Ursa. I secured my gear, made sure there wasn’t anything new on the radar and started the engine. 

On the long way back to the Slave 5 I thought about the last hours. I haven’t found any new data on the site, but it seems as if I encountered two syndicate members and gathered some information about this so-called December person. That surely was interesting. I had to end my report and send it to NOVA HQ. But this time I would also send a copy directly to ArchangelCorps. Maybe he got some other information that would help bring some light into the darkness. I safely reached my ship and set course to Area 18.
