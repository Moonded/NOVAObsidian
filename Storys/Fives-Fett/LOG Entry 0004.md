A few days after I arranged my meeting with ArchangelCorps I gor a message from him that said that he would have to move the meeting with me back, because he has a lot to do at the moment. So I used the time to continue working for the bounty hunters guild and also made a few missions with my squad at NOVA. Especially now after that massive problem with the banking system throughout the entire stanton system I could really use some good paid jobs.

  

For one of the mission for NOVA I was called to port tressler with my squadron. We had a special mission on calliope, where we would be deployed as an anti-aircraft shield to support the secure of a illegal drug lab on this moon.

For the mission we joined forces with other marine and airforce guys from NOVA. The Briefing sounded pretty easy. The airforce will go in first and clear out the skies and space around the facility. Next the marines and ground vehicles would arrive and secure the site. At last a transport ship would move in to transport the illegal contraband from the site to the advocacy. It all seemed as it will be a clean and well done operation.

There was just this one thing that bothers me. The leading commander said that the knowledge about this drug lab is very widely spread and that NOVA isn’t the only interested party, because the data about the lab was leaked through spectrum and so a lot of people are also interested about it.

  

As we moved out my squad and I got to our C2 that was already loaded with a ballistas and a centurion. We flew to a meeting point above calliope, where we waited together with the valkyrie of our marine team on the go from our airforce that the area was secure and we can fly in. Over the comms we heard that the airforce encountered some small ships around the site and they had to destroy them, because they started firing at our guys. Shorty after we got our go and we moved in. The drop went without any problems and while the marines where securing the building and the surrounding area I got into the centurion and moved it to a position about 500m away from the facility to give close range air cover. The ballista moved out a bit further, while the C2 took off to get and deliver a second ballista to the site. The marines where able to secure the building quickly, altough they had some resistance from the drug dealers. Shortly after our transport ship moved in and the marines began to load the contraband from the facility into our ship.

After a while our airforce reported that enemy ships are approaching. They told us that they spotted several fighter, but most importantly they spotted an A2 Starlifter. The airforce engaged the escort, but the enemies where organised too, so our guys weren’t able to get close to the A2. As soon as they realised that the objective of the enemy group was to make a successful bomb run they told our transport ship to move out of the danger zone. But somehow our transporter didn’t move. It seems that the pilot wasn’t on his station or something happened to the engines of the ship. With the A2 approaching me and my squad where doing what we were trained to do. My colleagues in the ballistas began to shoot there missiles at the A2 as soon as it was on the radar and in reach of the missiles. But it seemed that the pilot of the A2 was a pretty good one, because he constantly dropped flairs and chaff, so the missiles weren’t effective. As he approached the drug lab all our marines began to move inside the drug lab, but our transport ship was still there and still not moving. As the A2 flew over our base some of pur airforce fighters finally where able to break through the enemy fighters and began to engage the A2. They were able to destroy it shortly after, but they could drop a MOAB before the destruction of the A2. So we had an A2 bomb falling onto our transport ship. Luckily I was able to destroy it with my centurion, while it still was falling at the building.

The airforce could destroy the remaining enemies, but lost themselves some of our pilots. After some time our transport ship was flight ready again and moved out to deliver the contraband. I have no idea what the problem was with the ship, but I hope they will fix the issue before they come back.

About 15 min after the transport ship departed the leading commander ordered all personal to retreat from the facility, because our transport ship had some massive issues and wasn’t able to come back to the drug lab, furthermore they already cleared most of the stash out, so there wouldn’t be a lot of drugs left for any other party who will go there. So we moved back to port tressler were we had a short debriefing.
