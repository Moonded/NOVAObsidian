“Take it easy on the next turn. This isn’t some fighter or racer. It's your first time flying with her and I wanna take her home without any scratches!” “Yeah, sure Cap, I just wanna see how that baby flies.” 
Maybe it wasn’t the best idea to let Lis fly the “Slave 5” through the canyons of Daymar. Sure, I could retake the steering at every moment, I set priority steering to the copilot seat, but I think she might feel a bit insulted if I did that. So far she wasn’t doing bad with the flying. After our uneventful journey to Daymar I did some simple training with her like landing and take off and flying some maneuvers, so she could get a feeling for the ship. After that I let her talk me into giving her some freedom and let her fly on her own path. I hadn't thought that she would take us straight into the canyons, but here we are, flying around some very sharp edges in a ship that isn’t particularly maneuverable. But she holds up for the moment and I let Lis show me what she can do. To be honest I want her to be a good pilot so I can rely on her, if I need her. 

“You’ve seen that turn? I’m sure you never flew something like that yourself.” Lis called over the intercom. “Yes, I’m sure I never made such a reckless turn with my ship, but good to know she can do that. I think you have shown me your skills enough. 
“Please set a course to the nearest Outpost as soon as possible, I wanna make sure we don't got any scratches.” “You shouldn’t have said as soon as possible Fives, I’m gonna take a few more turns around that canyon before we go there.” She replied and I could almost hear her smiling over the intercom. 


She sat the “Slave 5” almost perfectly down at the scrapyard and I exited the copilot seat to go up to Lis. She was still sitting in the pilot seat smiling and giggling as I moved next to her. “That was some very good flying. A bit risky from time to time, but I like it. I think we will have a lot of fun together.” I replied, meaning what I said. 
“She flies great and with some tweaks here and there I think we can manage her to get even better on it. Thank you, that you liked my flying.” “It’s nice to have someone on board that also can fly my ship and to know how to handle it. I’m gonna make a quick walk around the ship to make sure you didn’t make any scratches.” I said to Lis with a wink.
I went outside and walked around the ship to make sure everything still was ok, although I didn’t expect to find anything and returned to the cockpit. “Now, if you want to, you can fly us back to microtech.” 

As we jumped to the nearest OM-Marker to set a course to microtech suddenly the proximity sensors began to blink. “There are three ships out there Fives.” Lis said to me nervously. “And we are getting hailed.” “Put them through.” 
“Unknown Drake Corsair, we are here on behalf of our business interests. We saw your ship leaving our facility without paying our business any visit or otherwise benefitting us. May we ask why?” 
“Hello there good sir, I am sure this is a misunderstanding. We just needed to have a place to set our ship down and to do some minor repairs. I didn’t know Brio’s Breaker Yard was under any protection.” I replied in trying to talk my way out of the situation. 
“The scrapyard is under our protection now and we are watching over it. Now if you want to pay me 100k Auec we can forget the whole situation and you can go your way. If not we will blow you to pieces. We give you three minutes to think about our very generous offer.” The connection went silent.

“Why are they doing that?” Lis asked me. “Well, I don’t know exactly, I think they are just some petty small criminals who want to make some quick money by trying to pirate some ships. What are they flying?” I asked Lis in preparation of the fight that surely was coming. 
“They got a cutter, a cutlass and an arrow.” “Are you feeling secure enough to steer the ship through the fight, Lis?” She looked a bit stressed, and I wasn’t sure what she would answer. “Ehm, I was never in an actual space fight, so I don’t know if I can do that.” 
“Ok, just keep calm and fly us through. I can control the weapons from the co-pilot seat, so you only have to worry about the flying, alright? Can you do that for me, please?” I asked her to calm her down and prepare for the next minutes. “Yes, I think I can handle that.” “Alright, let me get in the seat and then let's go.”

As soon as I was in the seat I redirected the control of the guns to my station and Lis began to approach the cutter. The small ship wasn’t made for combat, so I was able to destroy it quickly. 
The other two ships were a bit of a harder fight. As we now had lost the moment of surprise the cutlass and the arrow began to attack us too. I was able to land a few shots on the arrow, but it was too fast and I only hit its shields. Lis began to follow the cutlass and so I concentrated my fire on it. 
I was able to put its shields down and to destroy one of its engines, as Lis had to fly a hectic manoeuvre to evade a rocket that was coming from the arrow. She tried to fly away from the arrow, but our ship couldn’t escape a light fighter. 
As our shields at the back slowly began to sink I switched over to the remote turret and after some more manoeuvres I could shoot down the arrow. 
I released a breath of relief as I saw the debris of the arrow fall into the gravity well of Daymar. “Good work Lis. That was some good flying. Can be improved for the future, but good work for your first combat encounter. As I said before, I am sure we will make a great team.” I said to her over the intercom. “Now, please bring us home.”
