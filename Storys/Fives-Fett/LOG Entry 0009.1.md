Part 1/4

I was woken up by the familiar sound of an incoming message on my MobiGlass. I programmed it so that only messages from certain contacts play that sound and this one was for NOVA HQ. It was a few days ago, when I informed them about the coordinates on Lyria I found and my suspicion that those have a connection to the operation around The Orphanage there. I hoped that they really sent out some scouts to the location. As I opened the message I was delighted to see that there was a report attached to it. HQ has received my request and has sent out some guys to see what is out there.
As I opened the report and read through it I was sobered about it.

-----------------------------------------NOVA INTEL REPORT---------------------------------------------------
Location: Lyria OM-1: 189.1, OM-3: 295, OM-6: 341.3, near The Orphanage
Investigated location as requested by NOVA Ranger Fives-Fett.
Found an old caterpillar on site with the command module missing. Scan results: no lifeforms detected, engines inoperable, no power. Nothing else found in the near proximity. Left site to report back to HQ
--------------------------------------------END OF REPORT------------------------------------------------------

“Just an old caterpillar?” I asked myself. “That can’t be all that's there. And didn’t they even check the inside of it? It seems I have to cut my R&R short and head over to Lyria myself to see if that really is all what’s there.” It seemed that the NOVA scouts only scanned the ship and not even went inside it to check it. Maybe they have more important work to do than going after some info a simple member sent them, but I think there is more behind that. The data in the datacore from the ship of my mother wouldn’t have been so encrypted if it wouldn’t be something important and I’m sure my mother was after something important there. 
Originally I planned to stay a bit longer on Terra to be with my family and I already had some very nice days with them, but it seems that my attention is needed in Stanton and so I prepared myself to go back.


As I boarded the Slave 5 I went to my Armory to check what equipment I brought with me to Terra. As it was planned to be a family vacation and not a hunt I didn’t bring a lot of stuff with me. I had my standard armor in one of the lockers, one NOVA uniform (you never know if you need it), and some spare undersuits. For the weapons I brought two P4-AR’s and one of my FS-9’s with me, plus some LH86 pistols and two FSK-8 knives. For my scouting mission the P4-AR would be good if the situation would get a bit hairy in close quarters, but I would need an additional long range weapon with a good scope to check the situation from afar first. Another problem was the temperature on the moon. It was very cold out there and I needed some sort of protection. My standard armor would keep me warm for some time, but not forever. I had to choose between bringing a Novikov armor with me or a sealed vehicle to keep me warm during my approach. As I was going out with the Slave 5 I decided to get an Ursa Rover, so I could set her down quite some distance away from my target location and then move in with the Ursa. As for the long range weapon I knew a good weapons shop in Prime, where I could get a P6-LR sniper rifle with some additional scopes to get myself the range and view I intended to have for the mission.
Next step was to get an Ursa Rover. I knew they could be bought on Hurston, but I was sure there was a vehicle shop somewhere in Prime where I could buy one. After some searching and wandering around Prime I finally found a shop for ground vehicles and was able to buy an Ursa. They also offered to load it into my ship, so that part was also covered. 
I said goodbye to my family and headed back to the space port. I wondered how much time would pass until I would see them again. I really hoped that it wouldn't be years again. As I prepared the Slave 5 for take off I made sure that the Ursa was in the cargo bay and that it was strapped down and put the new weapon into one of the weapon lockers in the armory. I made sure that the fuel tanks of my ship were full and requested take off from the ATC of the space port. The sun was setting as I flew over the city and once again Prime was golden thanks to the sun reflecting on the skyscrapers and buildings in the city. I plotted a course to the jump gate and as I was out of atmosphere the meditating humming of the quantum drive set in as I jumped towards the gate that would lead me to Stanton.
