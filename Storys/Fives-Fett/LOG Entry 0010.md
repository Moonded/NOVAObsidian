The morning glow of the sun peaking through the window of my apartment in New Babbage gently woke me up from my sleep. I took some time off after my confrontation with the syndicate. While NOVA HQ was going over my report and I was waiting if they had new orders for me I went back to microtech, to have some R&R and go through the sparse data I could gather in the caterpillar. There wasn’t much data to go through, mainly the recorded conversation with the men I encountered on the caterpillar. One of the most interesting parts was the mentioning of the name december which I now know is some kind of leader or boss inside the syndicate. 
Further investigation by me showed that that name wasn’t set in any connection to the syndicate or NOVA. I have my own theories about who that might be, but nothing solid. 

A good message I received from the TFA during my research was that our missed commander Cepheus reappeared in Stanton. I’m glad he survived the destruction of his ship, although I wonder what he was doing while he was missing. He was gone for quite some time. I’m still thinking about that strange MSR that didn’t show up on my scanners, but some secrets can’t be uncovered by me.

I also went over the wreck of my mothers Avenger to see if I could get any new data from it. But after a lot of search and trying to repair various systems I couldn’t find any new data. It seemed as if my way was deemed to lead me to pyro sooner or later. But first I wanted to find out more about this December person. As it seemed they are still somewhat operating in the stanton system and finding december could be a much better way to get some info about my mother than just flying blindly into pyro and rolling the dice to find or find not anything in pyro. It would take years if not a lifetime to search the whole system. Especially if I’m doing it all by myself. I think it also would be time to look out for someone to fill one of the bunks on the Slave 5.
But at the moment my best bet would be to follow the path I found and see how far it gets me. 

I have to talk to ArchangelCorps as soon as possible, because neither he nor the NOVA HQ has sent me any message regarding my report.  Sometimes it can be unfortunate to just be one in thousands.
