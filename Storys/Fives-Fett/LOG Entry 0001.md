It’s been a while since my last LOG. There happened a lot in the last year. Not only did I end my service at the UEE Navy, but I also found myself a new home in the stanton system. It has been rough to get used to a normal life as a citizen again and at first I wasn’t sure what I will do after my service.

  

One day I stumbled across an Organization that operates in Stanton, that is called NOVA Intergalactic. Somehow they got their eyes on me because one morning as I opened my mobiglass I had an invitation for joining there org. I dont know what I have done to raise there attention, but it was a welcoming surprise. As I got in contact with them I learned that they are a very big org and have a lot of different branches in wich they operate. Altough they are very military like organised, the people are very nice to each other and helped me a lot getting along with my new life in stanton. After some time doing some stuff for the org and having a pretty good time I enlisted myself to join one of the marine squadrons of NOVA, more precise the first mechanized squadron, Osiris. Since then I think I definitely found myself also a new home at NOVA.

  

Altough the live of a marine in such an organisation is very nice and not to bad, I still fly through stanton on my own a lot of times. As much as I enjoy to talk and laugh with my colleagues I also enjoy the quietness and the large space when I fly alone. It has something of its own to fly through the stars all by yourself and doing some cargo transports or taking the prospector out on a moon.

  

Thats it for this LOG. I hope I will be able to do the next a bit earlier than this, but who knows.

  

PS: I heard some rumors about Drake Interplanetary, that the Corsair will be starting mass production soon. Cant wait to get one myself.
