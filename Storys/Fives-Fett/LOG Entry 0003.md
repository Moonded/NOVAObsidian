As my ship came out of quantum I saw the familiar white globe of microtech, it’s always a great moment when it comes in site. The white surface is so different from the planet where I was born, but the more I come here the more I begin to like it. As I raised my heat shields and began the entry into the atmosphere I thought about the pirates I encountered lately and the barkeeper that had sent me into this trap. After my second visit in his bar I hope he wont send more people into such traps, but who knows what those guys do.

My trusted Avenger Stalker has received some damage after the last bounty missions, so I need to find a garage somewhere near New Babbage to repair my ship in the near future. But first I need to get some rest and see if my Commander has sent me some information about any missions or trainings. I heard some rumors about a new anti-air vehicle that will be launched soon, I really hope that is true. Would make some great addition to the equipment of my squad.

As I walked into Wallyˋs I noticed some guys in NOVA uniform and shortly after, I sat by them and we talked about stuff. We began talking about some NOVA related things, so i could catch up to the latest news. We talked about our experiences at the last invictus launch week and which of the ships were the best, about the 8k Cruise that High Command held in celebration of our eightthousandths member, how each lf us enjoyed or disliked the thing that happened at jumptown lately and about how the ninetails are getting more aggressive in the last time. Some even said, the suspect the Ninetails to have planned something bigger than just blockading some stations. At the end one of the guys mentioned that one of our teams did a mission at the Orphanage where they freed some kids and that there is more behind that mission, than just rescuing children. They said the whole operation was lead by Wing Commander Bandaderarten and the Commanders Cepheus and Archangelcorps. Archangelcorps?,I thought, I think i remember someone that was called Archangelcorps. Some time ago, when I was bounty hunting around Arccorp, I think I met a fellow bounty hunter with that name.

It was during the time I had my first jobs in Stanton when i met ArchangelCorps. I was following a high-risk target through the entire system and finally catched him in a hideout on Lyria. Inconveniently the target had some guards and after I scouted the area as good as I could I made myself a plan to catch and kill the target. Something I didn’t knew was that there was a secret escape way from the hideout and as I dealt with the guards the target was able to escape through that way. I was only able to catch up outside of the hideout near the ship of the target, but when the target turned around to fight me I only saw a bright flash and the target fell dead to the ground. I immediately searched for cover because there was a sniper somewhere. I sent out an open comm message wich said that I am a bounty hunter and don’t harm any fellow guild members. Shortly after that my mobiglass received a message from a person called ArchangelCorps. He was the sniper and he wanted to meet me. We talked a bit how business was going and also decided to split the targets bounty, because we both played our part in getting the target. He took the body with him to bring it to the authorities and I made my way back to my ship. I was impressed by the skill of ArchangelCorps because altough I searched the area as good as I was able to I didn’t catched any site of him or his ship and by his very precise shot with wich he killed the target. Its nice to know that there are some good hinters out there who also are friendly and respect their guild members. I hope I will meet him again some time in the future.

At the next morning I sent a message to Commander ArchangelCorps:

„Good Day Sir, I heard about your Operations that happened at the Orphanage and wanted to ask you if you and your Team could need some help with this? I would gladly help you dealing with some criminals.“

Later that day I received an answer:

„We are always looking to add to the team. Why don’t we meet at Area 18 and we can discuss it?“

  

So than thats where I will head next. Area 18. Wasn’t there in a while, will have to see what ArchangelCorps will tell me and I’m excited to meet him.
