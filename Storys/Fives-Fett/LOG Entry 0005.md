Once again the guild sent me on a longer mission away from my home at microtech. Well, it is what it is, at least they pay me for the extra fuel I need. This time it is some guy who works somwhere on Hurston. He made some dirty jobs on the other side of the law and was hiding since then for a few months, but lately resurfaced as a worker, but I don’t have any information where he is currently, only that he works at a scrapyard. But I don’t know which one, so it seems that I have to visit every single one of them over the whole planet of Hurston. That will be a fun experience.
I talked to the owner of the junk yard and asked him about the ship. As it turns out, it was here for almost 4 years now. An honourable salvage crew found the ship drifting in space, damaged and without any energy, but without any signs of the pilot. As they scanned the ship, they saw that it had a special signature, which indicated that this ship wasn’t legal to salvage, but instead had to be brought back to some authorities for a reward. Luckily for me they brought the ship here, on Hurston, but the scrap yard missed to call my family about the finding of the ship. Due to the sloppiness of the scrap yard, I was able to buy the ship for a very cheap price and got a free transport of the ship to New Babbage.

While I was in quantum to microtech I thought about my mother. I last heard something from her 6 years ago, while I was serving in the military. A few weeks after that last message my father contacted me and told me that my mother was lost somewhere in space and that no one knew where she was or what happened to her. The only information we got from the bounty hunters guild was, that she was on a hunt for a group of criminals, but she never told us more about it and the guild didn’t want to give us more info. In all those years I since then worked for the guild and tried to keep up to her legacy the guild never gave me any more info about here.
A few days after I was back on microtech the damaged ship arrived at my hangar, where I was free to investigate it and to hopefully find some details about the ship and what happened to my mother. I’m not the best mechanic, but I managed to repair the ships computer and I was able to access the ships computer, or at least the last entered files

Kzzzt… “Log #231 …kzzt… 2947. I finally was able to catch up with those …kzzt…. in the Stanton system. They are my final …kzzt… to this big group I heard …kzzzzt… about. If I get just one of them …kzzt… they hopefully lead me to there …kzzzzz….. or at least one of their outpost to find …kzzt… about this mysterious …kzzzt…. They made a lot of …kzzzt… here in Stanton and still are, but somehow …kzzzzt… under the radar for a long time, it is time ….kzzzzzzzzzzt… the light. I know …kzzzt...in the pyro system, but I need …kzzzt…. coordinates and hopefully will get them when I catch …kzzzt….” *End of log*

The entry was damaged, but it still was very emotional to hear the voice of my mother after all those years.

*several days later in Lorville
I was sure that I want to go to the pyro system and see if I can find more information about my mother. But I shouldn’t go to pyro with my current equipment, especially my current spaceships. I have got some money on the side with which I am able to get myself a new and bigger ship to hopefully stand more a chance than in my Avenger. The rumours and also the official information about pyro say very clearly that it is a dangerous system, not only due to the solar flares of the star, but also to the many different gangs who rule most of the system and surely aren’t very welcoming to new people. There are currently three ships that are in my budget and would also serve my needs. The Drake Corsair would be the best choice for me, because of the many weapons, the scanning equipment and I already made some good experiences with my cutlass red. So I went to New Deal and bought one.
Well, at least I tried to buy one, but the salesman told me that they don’t have any corsairs currently. The simple answer to the question, why they don’t have it, was that the corsair still was in production at drake’s shipyards and that he could only reserve one for me. But the ship would only arrive in some weeks or even months, depending on the number of orders they received. And of course, it will take some time to get the ship from the shipyards at magnus to Stanton. 
I had no other choice than to tell the salesman that he should reserve one of the ships for me and inform me as soon as possible when he has any news about the production and arrival of my ship. I also had some other stuff to do to prepare my voyage to pyro and maybe they also needed some help at NOVA. Maybe I can even find myself a crew to go to serve on my new ship, but well, time will tell.
