*Incomming message for Fives-Fett*

**Lis**: Hey there Fives. I thought about your offer and I accept it. I really look forward to working together with you and traveling the stars. About the part with NOVA: I informed myself a bit and aside from the usual „propaganda and advertisement“ it seems to be a good employer, especially as they seem to not only need soldiers, but also other kinds of workers. We can talk about my application when we meet the next time, maybe you can put in a good word for me.
Where should I meet you next, so you can show me around your ship?
**Fives**: Good Day Lis, I’m very glad you accept my offer and I’m also looking forward working together with you. You can meet me tomorrow at 09.00 local time in my personal Hangar, I send you the details attached to this message. There I will show you around my ships and we can talk about how exactly we gonna go from there. 
**Lis**: I will be there tomorrow morning.
