Today i made a short trip to Grim Hex. My contact from the bounty hunters guild said that I will find my next target in this abandoned mining outpost. It was my first time at this place.

I heard some rumors about Grim Hex. That it was once a industrial center of the mining industry around yela. But since they mined most of the valuable materials from the ring the station slowly began to transform into an outpost for lawless people. And since the ninetails overtook the place the criminals seem to be attracted even more.

As my ship pulled out of quantum I first wasn’t able to spot the station. After checking my coordinates again I received a very noisy message: „… Welcome to Gree…M…Hab…“

As I asked for landing permission i received the coordinates for my hangar and the according symbol popped up on my hud. As I flew around the rocks I noticed the massive structure that was built into the central asteroid and i soon found my hangar to land in.

As I stepped down from the ramp of my ship I immediately noticed the filthy hangar and the various marks of past actions all over the place. I then went to the bar near the racing track to gather some more information about my target. The barkeeper was very helpfull after I gave him some „tip“ and he told me that the person I was looking for was soon leaving from the station and he even provided me with the info where my target was heading. As I left he called to me: „Be mindfull out there, a lot of people aren’t as nice as you might think.“

I went to my ship and flew to a position not far away from Grim Hex and waited there until my target left the station and the followed. As I came out of quantum my target was already there and there were also some other ships. As it seems I flew right into a trap. Those guys even got a mantis, so escaping wouldn’t be easy. I calculated my odds and as I made myself a battleplan my comms showed an incoming call: „You better give up and pay us 100‘000 credits, or we will blow you to space dust.“

My answer was surely not what these guys hoped for, but I was here to collect a bounty, not pay those guys money: „You can surrender now and I will only kill who I need to, or all of you will pay the price.“

As they began to attack my ship I first concentrated all my firepower on the mantis, so I could make a run if I needed to do so. After the mantis was gone I then started to pick the other guys one by one. Thankfully I upgraded my shields, otherwise I would have been in more trouble. As the last guy saw that the situation was hopeless he jumped away in his very heavy damaged ship. I have no idea if he made it out alive.

But I had my bounty and probably even some more. I will have to see if those other guys are worth some credits.

I also maybe have to pay this barkeeper at Grim Hex a visit, but first I need to collect my bounty.
