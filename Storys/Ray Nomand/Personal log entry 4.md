She was sitting in front of me in a huge chair behind the white roundish desk with just one tablet on it. Warm dimmed light, pastel colors of interior, even smell here was telling you to relax and think about something nice and positive, thou dr. Kamala wasn’t really settled even pretending to be calm and listening, I’ve seen that there are things she is hiding , something worries her outside this room, she definitely took some sleeping drugs last night and her body did not woke up fully yet, I can clearly see her face muscles micro frictions, hear her heartbeat and smell that tiny sense of aging… still can’t get used to old people, I never seen old people before I get here. She continues….

" For how long you with us Ray, more than 6 month by now, you’ve made amazing progress and gave us a few surprises along the way I can say, and me, as your curator, ready to sign you up for release, consider we are done here. Are you happy? "

"I don’t know doc, you know, we’ve talk thru that, the moment I pass that doorway, what should I do, where do I suppose to go and what for? [[Dr. Kamala]] took her tablet and turn it off"

"Listen Ray, let’s have a honest talk off the books. Between you and me, you don’t have to worry about your future at [[MicroTech]], with your talents you can find any job that will suites you, you can build a new life in a new world, not even a world in a endless universe, you are afraid because it seems overwhelming for you, but you will adapt much faster than you think, believe me, with your survival instincts you can overcome anything. Emmm…. Ray, I’d like to  you ask for a personal favour. "


"A favour? What can I do for you doc, check your knees problem? "

What? Knee? Ah… she start laughing.. "No, no. I want to  ask you to tell me what  happen there, the truth, I know you don’t want it, but this is important for me, and for you, can you do that?" 

I did not wanted to, I knew I have to go there one more last time, but everything in me screams, don’t. “If there is a fear, go there, face it” my father used to say

"Ok doc, but you should give me a promise and I’ll take it as lifetime deal, you know…"
"I promise, Ray, it will never leave this room"

"Ok. I look at the panoramic window behind her, at the blindingly white snow peaks of the Three heads Ridge, I look further to the endless rocks , rivers and forests of my home planet, land of the Ice and Storm……."

[[K’yati]] was on the Trail from place that on your maps called Ghost Hollow, we call it ***[[Aszani at Chimera]]***, closest translation would be something like: Inside the Monster womb, the Trail follows the tundra fields to the West, thru an old abandoned settlement that sits on the ***bank of the [[Muyt’tta]], a river rest***,  where all tribes meet once a year, for rest and recovery before marching a north mountains. It’s a beautiful and sacred area for us, where you can gather lots of [[Thawort]], dried and powdered it’s essential for us to survive the winter time as it can be a poison, but in a small doses it can increase your body temperature and helps to support metabolism at the levels where you can actually survive severe cold nights. This is why we’ve set a  camp to stay for a few days in this small paradise, getting ourselves ready  for a long march to the North-West to siege [[Carfrost]] range. I was, well, you’ll call it a tribe leader, thou we have no leaders in that meaning, everyone did what he or she was capable of. [[K’yati]] never been in need to create any social structure, because if you do little less than you can, to survive  you would not survive. I’m trying to understand whose mistake it was, mine, or the pathfinder, or it was just a cruel fate. The camp was very well hidden, few kilometres east  from abandoned settlement, we went for harvesting only at night, we follow the Trail as we did  generations before. But they found us, I felt smell of their engines long before they arrive and we send kids and woman’s march towards the mountains to the north, there where a secret cave called ***[[Yuzuthi Sak]] (watch your foot), its marked on your maps as N71***, and the rest of the tribe split on three groups moving north south and west. This is a best way to ensure tribe survival, someone will die, but tribe will remain and will rejoint later. But that time I did not know that things like scanners exists.. we had no chances against Sky People, they arrive on a black  ship and  two vehicles , hunting us like an animals. We fought back, oh, we fought hard, buying more time for those who marching towards the mountains and almost everyone who fought was killed. Oh, make no mistake, [[K’yati]] don’t  have firing weapons or metal Armor, but this is our land, we know it and we took lot of them with us. Oh that was glorious fight, snow turn red in the silent night where you can only hear heavy breathing mans and screams of dying… but…here I come to my biggest fails in my life.

I took pause, looking at my squeezing and unclenching hands, than I continue with low voice

One of the directive of the Trail says: “If tribe is at danger of existence it should accept the Fate and do everything possible to save as many [[K’yati]] as it can at all costs” I saw my people dying, yes bravely, but they where falling under fire of those thugs, there where no chance we win or escape, at least woman’s and kids are save now, so I command to surrender. It was my decision. Was I right? Or I condemned my people for miserable fate of slaves.
I close my eyes with hands, calming down a heartbeat, pulling down hormones level to expense where I’m no more affected by them. 

From 39 mans only 10 survive, three more, Astor, Ben, Thuli (poor old Thuli)  died in the next few days from wounds, our capturers didn’t care to heal us or to feed us. We were transported to the ***[[Muyt’tta]], they use this sacred place as a camp***. I thought they will bring us to the Sky Fortress to turn into the demons, I was so naïve… Sitting at the cage, pretending that you don’t understand their language, we learn a lot. Those people came from the place called Pyro, there where a part of tribe whose one of the business was slavery, smuggling and stealing. After few days I understand that they are not a Sky People, they actually afraid Sky People and stealing from them right behind their backs. They had some partners inside of New Babbage and trade with them and we, we… where just a little bonus, but after they lost so many man in fight with us, there where pretty angry and many of them wants to kill us instead of selling. We had no food, no medicine, we were sleeping in a cages under the open sky. You can eat snow and actually survive for more than a week without a food, you know, so we keep eachother as we can, planning escape or at least gave a last fight. And me…I was ruined, I knew that this is my fault, I should’ve not command to surrender so, at least we die with honour, not like a rats in a mud.

I went silent, I had to stop myself again, to get rid of emotions taking over my consciousness,  this time it took me much longer. Doc was sitting there, silent… I feel that she want to say something, that she usually do, but, surprisingly, he remain silent. 

***transaction paused***
