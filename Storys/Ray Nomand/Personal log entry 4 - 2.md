***session resumed***


They’ve shows up on our 17th day being captured, those [[NineTails]] how they called them selves, was preparing to leave this place as they get what they want from some client at the [[New Babbage]], and they discuss  what to do with us, slaves, and it turns out that the most of them wants kill us…. At this moment real Sky People came, we’ve heard them long before they show up: few of them was on another side of the river hiding in a grass, two was north- west to the settlement. I scent gunpowder, fuel and aggression.  I knew this mix of smell, surely it was a  [[Sky people]]. Their attack on the camp was swift, have to admit, I felt deep respect to them as to a great warriors. When the fight starts we break out from the cage, ask me how. I smile.

if you meet [[K’yati]] without [[Thon Spuli]] (small ritual knife that you get when you are born) hidden on the body, than it’s not a [[K’yati]], and we use them every night to broke cage rods. I command to the tribe run towards the  the forest side to the east and spread than, but when I reach forest line behind the walls, gun fight was over and I heard Maki screams from the camp side. ”I can’t leave him alone and just run” so I turn back, right onto the ship where Sky People just tiding up survived [[Ninetails]]…. I run towards them and scream… that moment I totally lost myself after everything that happens: 

Stop, please, we are not with them, we were captured, stop, don’t shoot, please… 

I can’t see the faces of the [[Sky People]] behind the blue helmets, but they were surely surprised to see dirty, half naked, pale man under -10 degree running towards them from  the forest. One of them tried to stop me, pulling his hands to me, I pushed him away and get one, straight, short and swift punch in face, very good punch I have to say…. After that I passed out and later I found myself at the hospital. 

That’s it doc, end of the story. I inhale and look at her eyes and we stay like this for a long minute, then she finally speaks 

Thank you, it was… thank you [[Ray]]. Now when you tell me the story, I think I can surprise you. There is a way to help you to find, or at least to find out what happened to the rest of your tribe...wait, wait. Let me finish. I can’t give a promise, but tomorrow you’ll have a visitor, and he is the only person who want and can help you. He is the [[commander]] of team who release and bring  you here. This meeting can turn your life to very new and unexpected way, if you want of corse.. 

Sure I do, I can’t sit here forever, but what this.. visitor what’s from me, doc? 

Wait till tomorrow, I can’t jump over his hear, so be patient. She turn on her tablet and suddenly change her voice into her usual doctor like mood, like she was speaking to someone else in this room

I’m finishing this session and we will talk next Tuesday, sad that we don’t have any progress today [[Ray]], but I hope  the  next one will be more productive. Have a good day [[Ray]], don’t forget to visit doctor Alison for MRT scan in 17 minutes. 

Goodbye [[doctor Kamala]]….
