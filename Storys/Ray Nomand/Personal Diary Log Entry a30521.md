It's been a three month since Alpha Hugo went missing, and there are still no leads as to his whereabouts. It's as if he vanished into thin air. I've been continuing my training with [[NOMADS]], preparing the team for whatever challenges lie ahead. But amidst the chaos, I find myself pulled in different directions.

I've joined a volunteer team at [[Frontiers University]], assisting in the search for rare flora samples on the moons of [[MicroTech]]. It's a thrilling endeavor, discovering new species and studying their unique properties. However, my efforts to help the tribes of MicroTech adapt to their changing world have faced resistance. They see it as a betrayal of their traditions, but I believe it's important for them to be part of a larger community.

Amidst my busy schedule, my primary concern remains Hugo. Initially, I thought he was on a mission in a distant location. But the passing weeks without any word from him raised suspicions. Official requests to [[NOVA Admiralty]] yielded no answers, as they claimed to have no knowledge of his whereabouts. It's unsettling, to say the least.

I've taken matters into my own hands and begun my investigation. I've been questioning our team members, trying to gather any information about the last time they heard from [[AlphaHugo|Hugo]]. I'm also planning to break into his apartments at [[New Babbage]] commons, hoping to find any clues that might shed light on his sudden disappearance.

The uncertainty gnaws at me, but I won't rest until I uncover the truth. Hugo is a valued member of our team, and I won't let him be forgotten. I'll continue my search, leaving no stone unturned, until I bring him back or discover what happened to him.
