I got stopped during quantum while I was in bed today. Idly inspecting my snagging bar, I take a bite and stare out of the port view to take a look at what stopped QT. It was a pity I didn't have salvage tools. Outside was a [[Misc freelancer]], in good shape for a wreck too, and I was surprised to find that not one person was in the area, I checked the wreck for valuables but it was obviously stripped clean before I got there. I think I'm going to do some bounty hunting, earn that last 100K to properly outfit my ship before I head off to [[Pryo]]. Hopefully things will be better there. As it turns out [[Nova Intergalactic|Nova]] also wants me to head to [[Pyro]], so maybe I can kill two birds with one stone. As it turns out Nova is involved with the investigation of some [[Orphanage]] or something, they want me to meet a contact of there's over at Pyro to see if they can unearth more information on the place. I wonder who the new guy is...
