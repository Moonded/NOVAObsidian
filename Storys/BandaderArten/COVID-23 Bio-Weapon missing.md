EVAing to the [[Starfarer]]

When reaching the [[Starfarer]] we opened the unlocked hangar bay in the back of the ship and slowly entered. After watching the upper floor where potential threat could have been coming from, [[Nozof]] and [[Surf]] went up the stairs on the right and [[Wolfiene]] and I secured the perimeter from the lower level. Then Surf killed three OPFOR straight in one line with his LMG and BLUE team went to the bridge clearing and securing it. Once secured they set up a defence line and prepared for leaving the hostile area. Meanwhile RED team slowly advanced and secured parts of the [[Starfarer]]. At the same time, the Enforcers under lead of Comd. [[Rob_Grayson]] with [[Atelion]] and Adm. [[Aingera]], joined up and swept the floors for any OPFOR, assisting RED team.

Directly below the quarters RED team witnessed the elevator going up and started investigating. After going up the stairs, we cleared the right parts of the upper deck. While departing one of the rooms, we got engaged by one OPFOR, coming out of the kitchen, nearly killing me. While taking a med pen, [[Wolfiene]] saved my life by killing the enemy. Once all decks were cleared, we RED team and the Enforcers nearly had a BLUE on BLUE, because the current positions werenâ€™t clearly communicated. After the ship was declared secure, Comd. [[Nozof]] fired up the engines and quantum travelled to [[Delamar]].

After reaching the outside of [[Levski]], we waited for our [[AirForce]] to catch up and finally secured the [[Starfarer]] on ground.

**Mission was a success, no body losses.**
