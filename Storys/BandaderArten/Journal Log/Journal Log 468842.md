System: Pyro
Ship: NSS Inquisitor

Having to be in Pyro is not one of the best tasks we did in the last year. There were so many good ones, e.g., defending Stanton from the Xenothreat or the NOVA Battlegrounds as trainings for our future missions such as the one we are on. It’s getting on my nerves, patrolling around space in Pyro, and not having a real task for us Marines. Those Space stations filled with pirate scum are just another thing I do not like is waiting in front of this Medic Bay. I hope our people are safe in there and get the treatment they need. The last fight wasn’t the best, but it was worse for our enemies. This makes the mission a success, still loosing people is nothing we really want.

  

Luckily, we had a small meeting a few days ago discussing our current situation and mission here in Pyro, declaring that our mission here is coming to an end, as I am needed at the NOVA Headquarters in the UEE systems for an important meeting regarding [REDACTED – SECURITY CLEARANCE NEEDED]. So, we are going to go back to Stanton and Area18 on Arccorp / Stanton III.

  

While moving back to the ship I sent the following message to my squadron:

OPEN LOG #4638745341

TO: Catulan Reavers

FROM: Cmdr BandaderArten

Hey my fellow Reavers,

I need to speak to you immediately, I know it is in the middle of the night. Please meet me in the meeting room in 5 minutes.

While on my way to the meeting room, I sent a short notice to Detreium, letting him know that we are going to meet up with the team and that he is invited if he wanted to join, knowing that he will more likely prepare our route going back home and checking the supplies we have onboard. He stayed awake all night already, doing this.

While turning into the hallway of the Meeting room, I heard some chatter out of it. Seeing Scredox and ArchangelCorps being in there already, I received a message from the training center: “Scredox tried and failed again at beating your highscore”. While grinning I said hello to the two and waited with them for the other ones to arrive.

  

Once they were all there, we talked about the current mission and that basically everyone is a bit tired of it.

“Good, then I have good news for all of you… Our mission is about to end tomorrow. I have been called to meet up with our Fleet Admiral of Defence for a matter I cannot talk about with you. Let me know if you need anything until then. Once we are back at Arccorp, you all get a week off, being able to do whatever, as long as you stay in Stanton and in close range to be able to be ready in less than 2 hours for any matter regarding NOVA Defence needs you.”

“Get back to work, or well sleep a bit more and I’ll see you tomorrow in Stanton already.”

  

While walking down the hallway towards my bed, Dolbi came back into my mind. I heard nothing new from him lately, that is quite uncommon, he usually lets us know about anything going on. Maybe he is still investigating with the Orphanage.

Might be something to investigate after the meeting in Area 18...

Hopefully my team is not doing something regarding it without thinking about consequences... especially Archangel and Scredox, since I notified them of it, they weren't really able to sleep. Hopefully that does not affect our team performance anymore...
