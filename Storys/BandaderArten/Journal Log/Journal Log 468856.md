N-ID: 2289101583194 - Wing Cmd. BandaderArten
System: Stanton
Location: Area-18 NOVA HQ

After reaching Baijini Point above Area 18 on Arccorp, I smiled. Seeing the Inquisitor docked there was such a good view. I had to take a picture...

When I eventually was able to acquire someone to ferry me down to Area 18 (horrendous prices here btw), I was finally able to go to our NOVA HQ in Stanton.

When the doors opened I was greeted by our own NOVA AI, who finally acquired a human form. She sent me the details for a room to my Mobi Glass. There are quite some good things being a Commander ðŸ˜‰

After a fresh shower and a small sleep, it was time for our meeting. High class security was around us all time, when I met with HC and our Fleet Admirals, as well as my Admiral Aingera.I cannot put it into my log what we discussed there.

Well, during the meeting I got promoted to Wing Commander. That is a bigger room in here btwâ€¦ nice cosy sheets.

For now I will go to sleep and hopefully can enjoy a nice breakfast tomorrow morning.

Next task will be to gather some information on The Orphanageâ€¦

After our week off, Iâ€™ll ask my team and eventually make my way into a bar around here to get some intel on it if possibleâ€¦ maybe there are some NOVA members who have found something already...
