"This debrief felt like taking ages of my time, Dolbi didn't look amused but when I was finally done, he asked me to form a Task Force. The name can be put in place by me, but I'll rather ask the team I have to form, so everyone can have a say in it, making us a better team from the get-go!"

  

I opened my MobiGlass... staring at it for some time, looking at the pop-up message. When I freed myself from the shock, I did send a short message to all of the participants of the Orphanage operation, to join the Task Force and be ready for a meeting tomorrow.

  

While I made sure to include everyone, I remembered Dolbis's words: "...send someone to collect this Malachite person. I want him interrogated...". How can we achieve that? I don't really want the ones who dealt with him already to be falling for a trap again.

They might be too close, I guess I have to have a look into their lives before NOVA again. I guess I could ask my friends from Frontiers if they can find more out about all of them, Malachite, and the people who dealt with him in the past. Might be beneficial in the future...

  

After I sent the message to Frontiers, I jumped under the shower and was able to relax a bit and go through everything that happened in the last few days. Unimaginable that a few weeks ago we were still somewhere in Pyro searching for some pirates.

  

I went out for dinner with some of the other Wing Cos currently at Area 18, having fun and drinking some alcoholic beverages. The barkeeper is actually a very nice guy. Eventually, I watched some episodes of the Galactic Tour with Jax McCleary, having a look for a new spacecraft soon.

When I finally fell asleep, I could hear the rain, just like at home... zzzz....ZZ...ZZZZ
