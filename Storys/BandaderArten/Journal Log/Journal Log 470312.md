**System: Unknown**
**Ship: [[NSS Implacable]]**

Awakening in the med bay of my [[NSS Implacable]], my eyes squinted against the dim overhead lighting. The surroundings were unfamiliar, the room's silence interrupted only by the dull hum of the ship and the sporadic blinking of the indicator lights. I couldn't remember how I ended up here, with no recollection of the events that led to my unanticipated displacement.

Cautiously, I sat up, my head throbbing with a dull ache. I surmised I had been unconscious, possibly due to some sort of accident, but without an AI system on the ship, I had no immediate way to confirm my speculation.

Stumbling to my feet, I made my way to the ship's control deck. An aura of mystery hung heavy in the Implacable, her usually bustling corridors now eerily quiet. I had to unravel this mystery.

Reaching the control deck, I promptly checked the ship's log for the past 24 hours. Entries hinted towards an unexpected power outage. During the blackout, it seems my life-support systems in my quarters malfunctioned, and I likely lost consciousness. That explained my awakening in the medbay.

Navigational data added to my growing concern. The coordinates showed we were not in Stanton system as planned. Somehow, the Implacable ended up in an unknown system. Apparently, some force had pulled us out of our quantum travel route and set us adrift.

Examining the ship's status, it appeared the complete lockdown initiated during the power outage had been lifted. There were no indications of any damage or unusual readings from the ship's systems. However, given the blackout, some minor systems were still in the process of rebooting.

Alone and adrift in an unknown system, the peculiarities were disconcerting. No memory of recent events, being ripped out of quantum travel, and awakening in the medbay. This was not just an anomaly. It was an enigma, and I was at the heart of it.

I sighed, running a hand through my hair. It looked like sleep would be a luxury I couldn't afford tonight. Time to pull a double shift, try to make sense of the situation, and most importantly, figure out where the hell we ended up.

With renewed determination, I set out to work. The stars outside the cockpit window looked alien, yet beautiful. Despite the uncertainty, I had a mission to complete, a ship to run, and questions to answer.

_It's going to be a long night._
