System: Pyro
Ship: NSS Inquisitor

The Mobiglass flashing red caught my attention. Opening it I saw a message on the NOVA Frontiers channel. After opening and receiving the message from Admiral Dolbi about the Orphanage, there was a decision to make. To either end the security mission being run in the Pyro system and help Dolbi with the Orphanage or continue running security and securing the next space station for NOVA and its members.

For now the decision was made that we will stay in Pyro, but depending on how the situation will change, we might be needed on Lyria.

So the message I sent to Dolbi was this:

OPENING MESSAGE LOG NSS Inquisitor #742674

“This is Commander BandaderArten, answering the Transmission on NOVA Frontiers! Me and my team, the Catulan Reavers, are standing by at Pyro on the NSS Inquisitor. If any help is needed we can be with you in a couple of hours with our NSS Swordfish (Redeemer). Standing by until further notice. BandaderArten out!”

Let’s see how this goes then...
