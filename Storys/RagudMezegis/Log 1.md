The grinding sound of metal on metal reverberated throughout the ship, punctuated by a loud “FUCK!” from the pilot’s seat.

[[Ragud]] was pissed. Not so much at the flight controller who’d assigned him the smallest hangar that could possibly fit the ungainly [[Taurus]], but at himself for misjudging the clearance between the engine pods and the hangar edge. He was in a hurry, and he’d foolishly let himself get distracted. And now it was going to cost him not only the time he was trying to save, but also money for repairs.

After taking a moment to calm himself, he reoriented the ship and lowered it gently into the hangar. The usual sounds of the hangar doors closing above him were reassuring, in that it meant the hangar wasn’t significantly damaged. [[Ragud]] figured he could get away with nothing more than a fine. Or in this case, a bribe.

It didn’t take much to convince the [[BlacJac]] boys to skip all the annoying paperwork. Mercenaries to the core, they saw the value in getting paid to do nothing, so [[Ragud]] avoided any official marks against his pilot’s license.

“Sorry,” [[Ragud]] said to no one in particular as he watched the [[BlacJac security]] official leave the hangar. He was pretty sure someone who didn’t deserve it was going to get in trouble for this. The plight of that poor, unfortunate soul was fairly quickly banished from [[Ragud]]’s mind as his eyes came to rest on the scraped paint and gouged metal on the lower engine pods of his [[Taurus]].
With the exception of that one section, the ship was in excellent condition. Every component was in perfect working order thanks to regular preventative maintenance. Ground crews gave the entire ship a once-over every stop at a reputable port. Even the 2951 [[Invictus Launch Week]] blue and gold paint job received regular touch-ups to keep it looking new.

This was a little beyond routine maintenance, though. Fortunately, Area 18 had good repair crews. [[Ragud]] winced at the final price tag as he hit the “approve” button on the work order, but the financial pain was a good incentive to not repeat this mistake in the future.
