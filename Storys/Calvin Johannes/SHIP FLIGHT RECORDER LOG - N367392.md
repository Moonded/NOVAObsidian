CALLSIGN: [[RIPPER]]
NAME: [[CALVIN JOHANNES]]
SYSTEM: [[STANTON]]
SHIP: [[NSS RIPJAW]]
LOCATION: [[MICROTECH]] SURFACE PATROL LOOP 6**

The blue and gold painted Anvil Arrow sped at just over Mach one in a long practiced patrol loop loosely circling one of NOVA’s operation centers. The patrol had been routine so far, and Calvin Johannes, callsign ‘Ripper’, sat in the cockpit, flexing his legs to keep the blood pumping for the long, boring patrol. 

He hadn’t seen anything interesting so far today, save for some pretty silver clouds, or the occasional surface snow cloud which may just contain the legendary Boreal Stalker hunting its prey. 

This was the third week of running this patrol route in his trusty Arrow, the [[RipJaw]]. A name taken in inspiration from his callsign, to some mild pokes from his squadron mates. Ripper had been an Air Force pilot for a couple years now, earning his wings and proving himself in Arena Commander simulations with the best fighter pilots [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] had to offer giving their commendations. 

Through all the glory and prowess he showed, Ripper did not expect to be stuck here, running repetitive, boring combat air patrol over one of [[MetroTech]]’s many lakes, protecting the scientists and [[NOVA Core]] transport ships as they run their regular duties in and out of one of [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]]’s numerous bases spread throughout Stanton. 

Calvin flipped a few switches in the Anvil cockpit, activated the Autopilot to follow the designated patrol route, and then reached up and pressed the button to the back of his [[StoneSkin]] helmet, popping the seal and allowing him to remove it. 

Placing the olive drab helmet on his right knee, he pulled a water bottle from the left side cockpit storage compartment and took a few quick gulps. Now satiated, he placed the bottle back in the compartment, and then returned the helmet to his head. A crisp *Pop* filled his ears as the helmet pressurized. His HUD showing green indications, proving he would be safe in the event of any depressurizations, at low altitude in the very *breathable* atmosphere of [[MicroTech]]. 

Calvin rolled his eyes. Sweaty helmets, sweaty under suits, frigid planets and an unbelievably **Boring** patrol route!
How much longer could he possibly stand this -....
A **beep**... “**CONTACT**”, sounded in his ears through the ship avionics link.

“A… What?! Here?!”


Just as soon as he had heard the ship call out a hostile, his eyes darted to an empty radar display. 
“God damn faulty [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] ships…” Calvin began to devise all the ways he would tear into the maintenance officer who would undoubtedly greet him upon completion of his patr- **CONTACT**. 

This time Calvin got a glimpse of a red ping to his high six o’ clock on his three dimensional radar display. It only lasted for a half second however, disappearing once again. 

This time unconvinced it was simply malfunctioning equipment, and having heard the recent [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] briefing on potential [[Syndicate]] Stealth Ships, he brought the throttles back to maintain 200m/s, allowing him the ability to spin his ship around much faster if he deemed it necessary. 

The high noon position of [[Stanton]] in the [[MicroTech]] sky made [[Calvin]] wonder if it was just a faulty Arrow radar/tracking array picking up the damned sun as an Infrared target. 

“**CONTACT**”.

This time Calvin was already looking at his radar display. He grabbed the centre stick and in one fluid motion, paddled off the autopilot and pulled the stick into his chest. 9 G’s of force sank him into his ejection seat as his under suit squeezed his legs in an attempt to keep the blood flowing into his head. He spun the Arrow around quickly, now it was pointing 50 degrees nose up, into the sky at the position he had last seen it on his radar display, which of course was now blank. 

Squinting his eyes into the sun, [[Calvin]] thought he began to spot a faint blue spec in the distance.
The blue spec grew brighter and larger, until he realized it was an EMP field! 
Throwing the throttle to max, and the stick full left combined with rudder and pitch inputs to invert course away from the EMP, fatefully the Arrow’s displays flickered out as the EMP passed over the surprised fighter. 

Now powered down, [[Calvin]] ran the memory emergency shutdown items, flipping switches and pulling levers in a rapid attempt to re-start the power plant as the Anvil Arrow pointed towards the ground and accelerated, being pulled by the frozen planet’s gravity. 

The analogue backup altimeter in the Arrow cockpit counted down rapidly from 2,000m altitude, Calvin hearing the wind rush over the canopy as the lifeless fighter picked up speed. 

The left MFD began to flicker as hydrogen powered fusion sparked in the Arrow’s tiny size one power plant. Some BIOS text flashed across the screen as the ship’s computers and avionics slowly awoke. 

[[Calvin]] pulled desperately on the flight stick, the control computers still unresponsive as the ship fell through 1,000m. 

[[Calvin]] heard the distant whine of plasma engines above and behind him, no doubt the EMP ship that had disabled him. 
Finally, as the ship fell through 500m, the Arrow’s screens lit up brightly, the main thruster roared awake, and the control surfaces became responsive. 
Calvin’s full aft flight stick was registered by the control computers, and the Arrow engaged aileron, ruddervator, maneuvering thruster and reaction wheel controls all simultaneously in an attempt to pull the plummeting fighter from the surface’s deadly embrace. 

A harsh 10G’s were pushing on [[Calvin]]’s chest like an elephant as the agile fighter halted its descent as fast as it could. Rising to level flight mere meters from the surface waters of the lake below. 

Finally back under control, [[Calvin]] released the stick to neutral, unloaded the fighter’s stubby swept wings, and looked upwards at his assailant. 

A sleek dark black and blue Aegis Sabre Raven flew in the skies above him at low speed, inverted, canopy bearing down on him from an estimated 1 km away. 

Now knowing his next course of action, [[Calvin]] engaged his Boost, the Arrow’s capacitors dumping what small amount of energy they had regenerated since the reboot into the mighty VASIMR main engine, the 1.25x increase in thrust helping to launch the Arrow back towards the enemy.
The Raven dumped its nose, picked up speed, and aimed right towards [Calvin] and the [[NSS RipJaw]]. 
[[Calvin]] split his power distribution between weapons and shields, and then squeezed the trigger on his flight stick, his ballistic cannons spinning up and spitting hot lead straight at the Raven.
Simultaneously, the Raven’s energy repeaters began to glow blue, with a hot, streaming series of plasma bolts emitting towards [[Calvin]]’s fighter in response. 

Both fighter’s shields flicker as the kinetic and energy rounds meet their marks. The energy rounds are absorbed entirely by [[Calvin]]’s FR-66 shields, while the kinetic rounds inbound to the Raven bleed through slightly, although only causing cosmetic marks on the stealth composite hull. 

The two fighters pass each other in a vertical merge at a combined relative 300m/s, [[Calvin]] getting a glimpse at the Syndicate fighter pilot, wearing their signature sleek armor set.

Now merged, Calvin decided to employ some more conventional atmospheric dogfight tactics. Making his Arrow work for it, he pulled the stick into his chest once again, placing his lift vector on the enemy fighter and pulling some throttle back to allow a tighter turn radius. 
Both fighters get nose on at the same time again, as the Raven mimics the moves that [[Calvin]] makes, both apparently experienced fighter pilots. 

They begin another head on pass at one another, a repeat of the last one with shields absorbing kinetic and energy rounds alike. 
Passed again, [[Calvin]] decides to roll inverted and utilize his 1,500m of altitude in a Split S type maneuver, hoping to throw off the [[Syndicate]] pilot. He rolls the fighter around, uninverts and unloads, picking up airspeed. [[Calvin]] looks up to see the Raven roll out of his maneuver, seemingly surprised that Calvin was not where he expected. Calvin pulls up at the moment the Raven becomes wise to [[NSS RipJaw]]’s unexpected maneuver. The two fighters, now too close for a head on pass, offset their approach angles and enter a rolling scissors. 
The Arrow was heavily utilizing its aerodynamic control surfaces, as the dense atmosphere of [[Microtech]] reduced the efficiency of his thrusters. Aerodynamic control surfaces, the Raven did not possess. 

[[RipJaws]] ruddervators deflected full up, pushing the Arrow’s tail down, pitching it’s nose up, helping [[Calvin]] claw every degree of aspect he could hope to build, trying to work his way behind the Raven. 
A few rolls later, [[Calvin]] appeared to be gaining an offensive posture in the fight, the Raven’s rear picture becoming more favourable moment to moment. The two fighter pilots engaged in a beautiful deadly ballet, only hundreds of meters over a cold [[MicroTech]] lake. 

Suddenly the Raven levelled, and engaged its boost, pulling away from the Arrow. [[Calvin]] also levelled and engaged his boost to follow. 
Gaining just over a klick of separation, [[Calvin]] engaged Missile mode, gathered a somewhat questionable lock on the Raven’s hot exhaust, and squeezed the trigger to launch a missile. 

The missile left it’s station inside the Arrow’s wing with a *whoosh*, a trail of fire rushing towards the [[Syndicate]] combatant at lightning speed. 

The Raven deployed flares and chaff. [[Calvin]]’s infrared guided missile, unsure from the beginning of the stealth composite and heat sink clad opponent, decided it preferred the signature of the flares and went for them.
Stunned at the fact his missile went for flares in a minimum range, minimum aspect shot, [[Calvin]] gasped at the sight of a Raven slowing and spinning about its yaw axis, pointing towards him in a quickly closing 500m separation. 

Surprised at the maneuver, which he didn’t believe could be pulled off in such a dense atmosphere, [[Calvin]] put his targeting pipper over the Raven and squeezed the trigger. 
A quick blue flash erupted from the Raven. A tactical EMP pulse, not the full charge, flowed over the Arrow, causing sensor and targeting disruption. What [[Calvin]] hadn’t noticed is his shields had been drained by the pulse as he charged towards his foe, guns blazing. 

The Raven avoided the incoming kinetics with a thrust upwards in a boost-assisted, backwards flying aerobatic [[Calvin]] had never even thought was possible, as it bore its guns down on him, that same blue charge building. 

Plasma bolts erupted from the blue gun tubes on the Raven, sending hot fire towards the now unshielded Arrow. 

Plasma struck the alloy hull right at the connection point of the right wing to the fuselage of the Anvil fighter. The hinge mechanism melted and the wing separated from the space ship. The 100m/s of airflow over the remaining wing now generating a massive asymmetry of lift. 

[[Calvin]] was stunned, he couldn't believe he’d been outmanoeuvred in such a way! “What kind of black magic trickery do these Syndicate ships utilize in order to be able to best *me*?!” he thought. 

[[Calvin]] tried for precious moments to recover control of his fighter as he picked up speed, barrelling towards the lake at now 150m/s, and 300m of altitude, his throttle still at full power. Realizing he’d lost the fight, [[Calvin]] decided to admit defeat by pulling his ejection handle. Explosive bolts detonated, releasing the canopy from the Arrow. Milliseconds later the conventional rockets detonated on Calvin’s ejection seat, wrenching him from the cockpit of the corkscrewing fighter. 

Sensations of cold, wind, pressure, and pain washed over [[Calvin]] as he squeezed his eyes shut during his departure from the doomed fighter’s cockpit. 
He thought of [[Mariah]], and his daughter [[Allison]], as he opened his eyes to assess the situation.

It appeared in a sick twist of fate, the ejection seat had fired when the fighter was inverted during its corkscrew death throes, launching him towards the surface of [[MicroTech]] at blistering speed. [[Calvin Johannes]]’ eyes fell upon the shimmering light blue water of the [[MicroTech]] lake, and its sandy beach, only centimetres below.
