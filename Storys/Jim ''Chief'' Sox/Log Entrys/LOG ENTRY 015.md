JOURNAL ENTRY : Jinn Sox

Into the Turret

When one of your major passions in life is to be surrounded by the depths of space, entering a bubble that reaches out and touches it without forgiveness is sublime. 

"Aft Turret - Active, sir."
"Good hunting, gunner."
"Aye aye, sir."

Then Jinn put his headset on, and put on some of his favorite ancient Sol tunes.  Currently, Metallica: And Justice for All.  He would dish out some justice tonight. Always good to hear something from a bygone age when time was still counted in Centuries...

"Target 147 mark neg 90."
"Aye, locked and loaded."

*The riffs play on in the background as turret fire lights up the dark*
'All is said and done, never is the sun... NEVER....!'

A brief explosion and the silent black of the void returns to Jinn's HUD.

"Splash Target, Sabre."
"Copy, incoming target 270 mark neg 30 hot."
"Copy."

*A simple tune plays and then the pounding of the beat powerfully matches Jinn's outgoing turret fire*
'Soon you please their appetite they devour, hammer of justice crushing you, overpower...!'

The moments go by as the Constellation Andromeda is circled by the Hammerhead.  Jinn puts out round after round into the death knell of the enemy craft.

'I can't believe the price... YOU PAY...'

The ship delivers a cascading blast that covers Jinn's turret in micrometeor debris.

"Zone clear, gunners, return to Mess Hall. Mission success."

Jinn didn't go anywhere - he was home in the lightless empty, and his music hadn't finished playing yet.
