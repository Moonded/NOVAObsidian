JOURNAL ENTRY :: JimSox

At Port Olisar, however, the resting took its toll on Jim.  Jim is a clone of an Intelligence Operative that went too deep into Vanduul space, died, and activated the JimSox clone. When JimSox was alone now, his mind was filled with emptiness that was meant to be filled by the life of another man.

Jim's original family knew their husband and father would enter into the cloning program, but never realized what that might mean to their lives.  When he died, and all of his belongings were willed to JimSox, the clone also received a download of most of Jim's operational memories before time of death.  This included the memories of a family that now refused to accept him or acknowledge him.

Love, laughter, the fullness of life - were emptied out and JimSox was left hanging on to photos and times of a life he was now estranged from.

It was difficult for him. Only the depths of night matched the emptiness in his soul, and he welcomed it.  His former self also loved to be in the solace of the deep onyx of an unknown cavern, or the eerie speckled light of a far away sky.

In his heart, tho, JimSox wanted a family he would never have.  It plagued his mind, and made him a virtual work a holic.
