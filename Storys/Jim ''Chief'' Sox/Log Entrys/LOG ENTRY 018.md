JOURNAL ENTRY :: Jinn Sox

A New Day Dawns

Jinn was doing his research, checking all of the latest stats of ships - and sold his Stalker during the height of the International Aerospace Expo.  Perfect time to sell is also sometimes the best time to buy.  He had been skimping on everything for months for this show, and he wanted something that he could rewire.  

It didn't have to be the most expensive thing, or even the most desirable.  This year Drake was doing their thing  and that is all well and good, but Drake is old hat.  Everyone knows their stuff is fantastic for engineering. You get all those exposed wires to play with.  

No, this year, Jinn wanted something - something that spoke to him in a new way.  And then he saw it. The Esperia Blade. Alien designed [[Vanduul]] mock up for OpFor to the UEE.

You know what? How about that And the Glaive for testing.  The weapons are stock, but the guts - the guts are variable.  He can play with that for a while and find out if alien means *different*.

He bought the two vessels, and took them home to his hangar in Area 18.   Its a new day, with new things and a new perspective.  Now that most of his UEC was spent, he decided to treat himself to a dinner at the GLOC bar to celebrate.  

He put his Big Barry's spicey noodles down, took a swig of Schmoltz, and headed out of [[MicroTech]] a happier man.
