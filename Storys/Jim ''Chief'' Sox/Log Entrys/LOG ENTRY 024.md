Jim "Chief" Sox -
The power of a gun

Jim was a simple man at heart - he left the complexities of life to the components he tested in starships; and even then he attempted to simplify, simplify, simplify.

But the Verse was more and more complex as new discoveries were made. Mysterious stellar formations, interesting artifacts, and new species of life abound, and Jim - to maintain himself - put a blind eye to a lot of it.

One thing that was as simple as does, however, was his Salvo "Esteban" Frag Pistol.  He used a Suppressor and a Delta x1 Reflex Sight on his. Enemies were simple. You just had to shoot first, and fire with excellent accuracy. 

A knife and a pistol were going to be his best friends.  He could store a knife under his shirt, and maintained his pistol - even when wearing plain clothes.

One thing about a weapon, however, was its ability to change the world with a single blow.  In an instant, a life would end. And the hole that life left in the Verse is not something to be taken lightly - and for his part - Jim tried to think of what his actions meant; to an extent.

Jim tried not to think of the Verse in colors.  He tried to see it in Black and White - because it kept him from flinching in a fire fight.  When the enemy dropped, it was a positive change to the Verse; at least he hoped so.

With a single shot, he could change the world. With eight, he could effect the entire Verse.  He tried to stay blind to all that he did to that end, and just logged in and did the job.
