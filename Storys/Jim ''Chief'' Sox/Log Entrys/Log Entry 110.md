I have been considering a two man infiltration ship that you all might take into Operations. Ships considered were the Scorpius, Hurricane, Terrapin, Reliant TANA, Super Hornet, and others.  Getting a ship to within minimum emissions as well as keeping Proximity low were key factors in determination of the type and results of the test.

Also to note were the parameters of environmental concerns of the target ground LZ.  Further considerations were scope of range on scanning equipment, defensive capabilities, cargo capacity, and other thoughts.

This ship is set to perform on the MISC Odyssey Platform as its Runabout, so I wanted to give the vessel the best multi-use options as possible in its final consideration. This took out many ships, including the Reliant Class.

Given: MISC Odyssey Explorer in Deep Space unsupported
Need: Reconnaissance vessel, Fighter, Courier, Infiltrator, Intelligence Craft, Special Operations Craft.
Possible desirable : Medical bed

While the F7C-M cannot provide a medical pickup, perhaps a ground vehicle can fulfill that role and we can land the Odyssey for a full extraction of injured personnel.

Statistics of the F7C-M Heartseeker (if you use a ship you love, you love the ship you use!)

Fighter Loadout :: Full Fighter Loadout stored in the Odyssey with Turret, 3x Size 3 Guns, and 8x Missiles. Guns are laser mounted due to ammo limitations in a dogfight in deep space.

Recon Loadout :: Lightfire Quantum Drive with Long Look Radar and mimum specification weaponry for silent running.

Cont'd ...
Courier Loadout :: Stor*All kit for 2 SCU transport from ground to ship.

Infiltration Loadout :: Turret with minimum spec weapons loadout and 8x Missiles for stealth insertion of a ground team to investigate surface locations. Known EM and IR as of writing 3500 EM / 4500 IR Lightfire Quantum Drive for max distance from ship and round trip capabilities.

With the possibilities of this particular ship into account, it is my belief that it is the best installation for the Odyssey's use with RAVEN Wing.

You won't find a more versatile ship to place in the hangar and run all possible operations in a deep space expeditionary vessel.
