JOURNAL ENTRY :: Jinn Sox (Begin)

Jim was drunk.  He had spent his time off in the GLOC bar on Area 18 downing as much Radagast as his belly could handle, and the Engineer had crafted himself a full on dizzy spell.  Screw family, screw it all - Jim knew he was just a mass of cells poured into a chamber, and it plagued his mind.  No, maybe he had to live this way, but his future selves would not.
He went into a private cloning facility to edit himself.  He was still in transfer into ARIES, and his clone at this Kel-To location had not yet been reset to his new Squadron.
He hacked into the cloning mainframe using his skills as Intel, and began editing his future Clone. The natural degredation of the cloning process would help the agent do his work.

 Jim, in his stupor, didn't realize what he was doing - and when he entered into the sub-clone processing, his upload errored. Jim entered the cloning chamber to change his life, permanently.  He just didn't realize what it would mean. During the upload, Jim passed away and Jinn was born.

....##** ERROR **##,,,......  REBOOTING... 

At that moment, the comm array was shut down, and the entire facility was raided. As Jim's life ebbed from him, and the faulted JinnSox clone activated the skirmish raged on. The Nine Tails were fought off, but the facility was definitely not at optimal capacity. Some of the Nine Tails assaulting the base came off with cloning materials and their goals were met, but in removing certain elements from the cloning process, Jim became Jinn.

Jinn awoke, naked and ashamed.  Something felt off. Something felt wrong. That's all Jinn knew.  The clone couldn't think clearly, and then Jinn's mind turned into fire.

****REBOOT COMPLETE :: Processing clone data transfer )))---

The new clone wasn't supposed to be *alive* during this process, but Jinn was in full effect as memory after memory and all of Jim's work flooded into Jinn's mind.  It took some bit of time, and Jinn barely survived the process.

The moment Jinn got out of the chamber, their weakened body shuddered in agony, and using anything available Jinn almost OD'ed on med pens.   Two hours later, the NOVA Rescue Team arrived to pick up some of the facility's defenders, and Jinn was found.

"Holy moly, what the hell happened here?" The unknown saviour discovered a clone bay in a complete state of madness, but in the midst of it all - a NOVA member signature scrambled as it may be was staring at him completely passed out.

"Don't worry, kid, I will take you home."  

Sometime much later Jinn awoke in a NOVA facility with their remaining clone signature successfully and completely placed into the system.  One more chance at life remaining, Jinn wasn't about to waste their days. Whatever was behind them no longer mattered, what mattered was today.


"Sir, JinnSox reporting for duty."
