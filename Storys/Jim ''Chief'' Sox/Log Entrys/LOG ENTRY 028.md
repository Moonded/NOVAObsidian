Jim "Chief" Sox

Personal Journal : Family

Jim had been through a lot with NOVA now. He was no longer a green recruit arriving in his beat up Terrapin now at a salvage yard. He was a Commander in the Raven Wing of Frontiers.

Somehow in the year he had been here, he had gained respect from his peers.  He had never had that before, and it just hit home how much his life had changed since his humble beginning.

He had designed and built countless craft for his companions - and they all seemed to enjoy his work. He has now gone to the fringes of the solar system, and lived to report back his findings.  He had worked with and aided Admirals.

His life felt full.

A toast to NOVA, and a beer on the table for those unable to join in it.

Lately things around NOVA had shook up a bit, as people came and went. But Jim knows his home is here. He knows his family is each and every member within this great and amazing experiment called NOVA Intergalactic. Would they ever see another Galaxy together? Time will tell.

Until then, godspeed into the great unknown!
