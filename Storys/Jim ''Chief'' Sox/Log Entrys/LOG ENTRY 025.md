RE: The Gift of a Blade

"Welcome aboard, Jim.  I see you are settling in and getting things sorted out." The Admiral stated plainly as the new member stood at attention in front of his desk.

"At ease, Cadet. Let me introduce you to the ship. You will be joining me on the Upper Bridge with the team assigned there. At Battle Stations you are expected to run the Starboard Turret.  During Away Missions you are a part of the Away Team. Is all of this understood?" Zed looked over his new Cadet closely to see his response.

"Aye, sir!  I stand ready." Jim knew that this ship would need him at a solid discipline level when necessary, and in this meeting, it was necessary.

"Good. I am glad to have you on board the *Cousteau*, before you go out there, I have something for you to prepare you for the days ahead." The Admiral opens his top drawer and brings out a knife of Banu design. "Do you know what a Pambada Knife is, Cadet?"

"No sir." Jim replied honestly, not having much to do with Banu culture.

"This blade can cut through most rope, is a utility knife, but can also be used for combat.  Are you versed in knife fighting?" 

"No sir." 

"Then you will learn on this blade.  It is my welcome gift to you. If you are ever stranded out there, something like this will be more and more valuable to you." The CO sheathed the knife, and handed it to Jim.

"Thank you, sir. I will learn all its uses." Jim replied.

"Very good. Attention! Dismissed!" 

Jim hopped to attention, did a crisp about face, and left the office.![[Pasted image 20230712222644.png]]
