The Beginning to Section 07

*To all who bear witness to these proceedings, greetings*

*It is hereby noted that Commander JimSox will head Section 07 and prepare teams for Research and Development under the Intelligence  Directorate of the Frontiers....*


Jim just looked at his Mobiglass and stared at it.  He then packed his gear from ARIES, boarded the Sol Searcher, and proceeded to her secret birthing station at MIC L2.  From here, he could build and test NOVA equipment and ships and give feedback to NOVA Wing Commanders to hand down to their Commanders for use in Operations.

For now, he would keep his attention on Frontiers' Engineering Directorate and building expectations, but once everything was set; he would start tests.

He would live deep in the darkness of the black, and in that depth - would arise a NOVA stronger than perhaps anyone could have thought.

That was his hope.  Let's Begin.

*Superiority through Technology, Commander S-07*
