JOURNAL ENTRY :: JimSox

"Jim, you are activated - Defend the Outpost - Here is your Org Armor, an A03 without scope, suppressed with a pointer, and a S-38 One Empire Pistol. 4clips A03, 2 S38.  Do the Lord's Work, son."

The senses of Jim heightened, "You got it Old Man."

-- LATER --

The elevator lowered Jim into the pit of some stinking hell hole somewhere that was about to be assaulted, if Intel was to be believed.  There were some mercs on scene, and Jim would use them as cover fire.

The first wave of assailants met the Mercs, and were thinned through - conserving ammo, Jim took down the last 2 quietly, and reset position. Plenty of Mercs Remaining.  Intel on site showed 6 more incoming, and Jim set his jaw.

They tried to be sneaky, but one by one, the A03 popped their lights out.  Jim had to watch his reload times, they were going to either kill them or him - and 15 rounds in the chamber of an A03 were somewhat unreliable at the best of times.

Light armored target, Jim switched to the trusty Pistol, and made easy work of him. No one knew his position, or they would be directly assaulting it.  The 6th member died, and the Recon Man reset.

8 scum remaining. 2 Mercs left to take fire.  The 2nd Merc took heavy fire, and died a quick death. 1 Merc remaining, 7 scum left as Jim kicked the head in of the Strong Arm wing of this assault. These guys would kill Jim easily if he let them.

Then they Hunted Jim while the last remaining Merc hid.  Jim had to pick his shots and his targets well. He popped a heavy, then left a medium guy alive with a shot to the torso, that brought more to his position where he put down the rest of the team with constant fire from his A03.  8 rds remaining in his weapon, and 2 more upstairs.

He crept up the stairs, spotting one crossing into a server room - 6 rds left, and one more to go.  The last Merc got his hit in, and avenged his fallen by killing the last member.

"Mission complete, Sir."
The pay was well worth the risk.
