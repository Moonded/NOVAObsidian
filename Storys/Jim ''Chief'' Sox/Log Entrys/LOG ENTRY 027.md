Jim Sox
Personal Log : A New Family

Jim was looking through the recent changes in the Squadrons on the NOVA Portal when something piqued his interest.  WANTED: Communications Officer to live on board the Carrack *NSS Cousteau*. Duties to include....

Wait a minute, a chance to live on board a ship flying into the unknown?  Hang on, and they need a comms officer? Why, there was a time when Jim would run communication equipment for civilian companies during Clone Life - what was it now? His first life?

He might qualify for a position there.

His work with Engineering was coming to a close as new systems were being developed and his knowledge base was drying up. Maybe this would be a chance to try something new!

He applied for the position.  Who knows what information the Carrack's communications array could pick up out there. Maybe distress signals, solar flare noise, alien data transmissions, it could be anything.

He found himself excited to fly into the black again. Ahh yes, his home, that gulf of emptiness that was deep space. It filled you with it, made it into your soul, and you either took it all in and accepted its vastness within your mind, or went nuts.  Jim did both.

When in that depth of black, there is nothing but the sound of deafening silence.  But here, on the *Cousteau*, there would be friends around. There would be the sound of activity, engines, and people.  It wouldn't be empty.

He had to try this!
