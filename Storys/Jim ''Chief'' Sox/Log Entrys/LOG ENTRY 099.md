Engineer's Log, Supplemental - The Mercury Star Runner mission was a success and I am soon to be promoted as a Commander of my own Squadron of 10 personnel.  The journey that brought me here has been one ride after another, and though my previous clone, Jinn Sox perished in an elevator accident, NOVA cleaned up my records and I am now fit for duty.  I don't have any suppressed memories, and my cloning systems have been completely revamped due to the doctor's inside of NOVA's umbrella.

My service record has been good and everything is set.  I can't believe what all has gone on since my Terrapin landed here all that long ago. A broken down Rental being transported to the salvage yards, I am surprised I even arrived! 

There was an escort mission, hostage situation, sniper challenge. There have been pirates at every turn and combat.  I am ready for my new Vulture to come in so I can relax and earn money for Research and Development. My second home.  One thing I have learned. Life in NOVA is never boring and I cannot wait to see my future years with them.
