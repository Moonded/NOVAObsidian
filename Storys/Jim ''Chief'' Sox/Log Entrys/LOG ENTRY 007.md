Enter the Lady Jaye

"Yes, 50% Shield power and 50% to engines feels right."  Taking the Lady through the canyons of Daymar at about 60 m/s velocity felt good to the newly christened Engineer, and Jim was back at his home turf - running ships through the atmosphere of a moon that held yearly endurance races.

"Now boost brake, 125 degree left turn, boost through the curve, and power through the straight... Atta girl, you got this!" He pushed and pulled and twisted his joysticks into their precision movements that translated into a very good Taurus running through the pits of Crusader's moon.

"Now, we are out of the Canyon, let's get out of atmo and burn mains. WOW!" Jim was thrown back into his seat as his Lady showed him her curves.  She was a thing of beauty.

"Right, Ultraflux powerplant, I knew it.  The finishing touch on a glorious Recon Vessel for ARIES."  He docked the ship at CRU L1, and for fun scanned a ship 20 km away.  "Inbound vessel." He said to no one, imagining a fully manned Lady Jaye and seeing ghosts move about the ship.  "Yeah, you will do, girl; you will do."
