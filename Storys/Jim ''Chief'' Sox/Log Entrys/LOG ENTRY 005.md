JOURNAL  ENTRY :: JimSox

Jim's "Lady Jaye"

The Taurus was assigned to Jim. He didn't choose the ship, it chose him.  And the ship was a cacophony of parts and systems that he had to figure out.

"Size 1 coolers?  What is all of this about?"  So, the brand new Engineer set to work designing a Constellation for the Reconnaissance Squadron he was a part of.

"Let's see, Ultra Flow coolers should do the work, if we mix them with ballistic C-788's... and then a shield generator that doesn't tax the cooling system... Hmmm, the Guard is a very low emissions and low coolant draw generator. Yes, and we need quick spool times and long range, I will choose the Sunfire Quantum Drive..."

He put in his notes and sketched out a Plan for the new Cartography Vessel and Transport.

"Hmmm, size II missiles, I will stock her with Domies and test."

The new recruit went to work building the ship, and after two months of effort, she was ready for a field test.
