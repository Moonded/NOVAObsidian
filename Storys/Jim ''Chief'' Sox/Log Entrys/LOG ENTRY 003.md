JOURNAL ENTRY :: JimSox

The Avenger was tuned up and wired tight - and Jim decided to have a Canyon Test Flight at Daymar.  Wooshing between the walls of a canyon and pushing his ship in atmo tested the Recon man to his limits - and if you crash on Daymar, you hope no holes were punched in your armor. Its not a friendly moon.

The ship listed, twisted, and lunged into various attack angles as its pilot learned the ship.  A few times, Jim swore a bit of rock would tick off his wings as he would clip by a canyon surface at high speed, but he didn't care. It was his freedom. His freedom away from home, away from the drama of family, and away from any troubles that might be plaguing his mind.

As the night grew dark, the Recon man slowed down only slightly to check the terrain with his Radar PINGs.  It was a beautiful desert night, and he was beginning to feel at home with his Stalker.

Someday, he may need to use his transport cells to move wanted criminals to a high security secret location, and he was going to make sure they got there.   Or, maybe, he would be transporting even more valuable cargo on board his ship. Maybe.

As the night grew on, Jim pushed the ship to a 90 deg angle into the starlit sky, and blasted his way to Port Olisar for rest, relaxation, and refuel.
