Straight outta Area 18

The new Commander stepped out of the G-Loc bar with a full buzz on. He was not as drunk as he used to get, but he definitely was celebrating his achievement.   He strolled through Dumper's Depot, Center Mass, and Astro Armada shops. 

These places are what made him an engineer in the first place. Testing everything they held in their stores with each piece of UEC he could earn or find.

He looked at them all, completely familiar with everything they offered.  He was known as Chief to his subordinates, and Jim to his friends.  When his family shunned him so long ago, he never knew it was only a step into this new family. NOVA.

He will never look back at that time again. Demon, Lucy, Oli, ARIES - Frontiers - NOVA - These were his family, and Area 18 - His Home.
