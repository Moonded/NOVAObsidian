LOG ENTRY 001: Jim Sox

A New Ship

The Terrapin shrugged along in Flight Mode, pushing passed a number of vessels in various states of disrepair.  The old girl was about to join them.

This ship had served Jim well in time of need, but it was beyond maintenance and repair now.  She was going to the salvage yard.

"Going to miss you, even if you never worked right."  

In response the engines sparked a fresh fuel leak and the ship listed on a major torque imbalance.

"Yep, its time you rested for sure." Jim patted the old Pin one last time before finally shutting it all down in the dead silences of space.

Frowning, he exited the ship and EVA'ed to an awaiting MPUV Personnel craft.

"Well, sir, I will take you to a transport that will send you to Hurston Dynamics for a New Deal. You have any idea what you are trading that thing in for?"

"An Avenger Stalker. Lady Luck is a Dancer, she will be called."

"Then best of luck to you, sir."

Jim nodded silently to the cab driver, but there was a fresh glint in his eye that wasn't there before.
