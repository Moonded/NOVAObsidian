Commander Jim "Chief" Sox
Location : MIC L1 Dry Dock - "NX-1784039 Lady Jaye"

"The Lady Needs a Name"

She was ready. He finalized her parts and brought her before NOVA Command. It was his gift to NOVA, and she would serve her Organization as a multi-role vessel.  And she was ready.

All his friends were there, Dolbi, Alpha Hugo, Maleksi, DemonikWolfe RayChaos, Fives Fett, and so many others he could no longer count them.

This was his moment when he gave something back to the family that adopted him, and he couldn't be more proud.  But Lady Jaye was her test tube name, and he was thinking of what he could place on her when she got her NOVA Stormbringer paint.

"I wish I was so lucky..." was one comment.
"Wow, that ship can dance!" was another.
"She's got a lady's curves alright." was more
"Jim.... JIM...COMMANDER! We need to register the ship with our Org, what are you going to call her?"

"Ummm, well, uhhh.. Lady Luck is a Dancer... yeah, it fits..." Jim stuttered.

"Done. Please sign here. Here. Here. And Here."
"That all?"
"For Page One. Now initial here, here, over there, underneath this line. And final signature on Page Three, here."
"Done."
"Everyone! Some Radagast is at your tables. A toast!"
"A TOAST!"
"To Registry NSS-33893 Lady Luck is a Dancer! May her luck be as good as her namesake!"
"HEAR HEAR!" *everyone drinks*
"Now, if you would do the honors?"

Jim takes out his bottle of champaigne, and EVA's out to the Lady, and breaks it across her hull.

"HUZZAH!"
"HUZZAH!"
"HUZZAH!"

"She's a fine ship, Commander." His new CO, Admiral Zed Debrin comments.
And on down the line, his friends all welcome the Lady to her family.

After this moment, Jim was ready for his new station on board his new ship. Nothing left to tie him to the world and all of his work completed, he transports onto his humble bunk aboard the *Cousteau* and sleeps like a baby.
