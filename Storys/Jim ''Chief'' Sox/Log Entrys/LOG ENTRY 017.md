ID : #1030196 Jim Sox - Commander: Section 07
Location : Drake Caterpillar *Sol Searcher* - B Deck - Command Pod
Home

Jim awoke to the sounds of cargo being loaded into the guts of the Searcher, and wondered what time it was.  He was loading materials for use in the next Raven Wing Op, and as their primary support squadron, was ensuring they had all the food, equipment, ammunition, weapons, etc that they would need. Hydrogen fuel, Quantum Fuel - the Caterpillar was a solid ship when it came to delivering supplies to the Wing.

But that wasn't the reason Jim called the Searcher home.  It was his Training Vessel for Section 07 Engineers and Future Raven Wing Agents.  Not everyone would stay on for engineering and Jim had an open mind.

He got out of bed. It was 11:52pm Local Time.  Where was he again? Oh right, Gallente Farms had a flash sale on some of their aging greenery, and Jim knew soldiers would eat anything so he was buying some.

Jim toured his ship. From the nearby tractor beam terminal currently in use, to the gun racks, around the horn of the shower stall, he just loved his Sol Searcher.  

He hadn't dedicated any position on board this ship because its primary existence was to place recruits in a station, train them on it, and then move the recruit to the next one and so on and so forth.

But to Jim, this ship was his home.  Let the people come and go, he preferred the cots on this ship to any fine concierge hotel room; because he owned it. It was his.  Possession is 9/10ths of the law, or what, but this ship had no debt to it. It was paid off.

He would keep up on the insurance and maintenance and all of that, but he trucked his way through space this past year to buy it - and now all of it belonged to him and him alone.  It was just as good as commanding a squadron!

The crew came aboard from their shore leave storing their Hull A, M50, 135c, etc at Gallente's modest Landing Zones. Some hirelings would take the sporting ships to the next port of call for their amusement so long as the service was available, and the current crew loved the break from training.

There are two turrets on board, two tractor beam stations, a server room, 4 cargo bays and a front loading bay, and an engineering station on board the Searcher.  The vessel did not carry vehicles very well, but what it could house in its decks made up for it.  Today the team was training search and rescue support.  The cargo from Gallente Family Farms finished loading, and the ship was filled with various supplies meant for any situation a medical team might face in their mission to save a poor downed pilot.

The Server room clicked to life, and the information from the rescue beacon filled its databanks and the operation began.

The two tractor beam operators moved to their turrets, and the server room monitor remained at his primary engineering console.

The pilot took the Helm, and I took position in the co pilot's seat.

"Beacon Destination  - Aberdeen. Time to mission failure 45 minutes."

"This is why we have a top of the line military quantum drive fellas, let's kick it into gear and bring them home!"

The ship whirred to a new life as the quantum drive began spooling up.

The Engineer got into his Pembroke suit, geared up for the rescue, and checked over his equipment to make sure it could handle Aberdeen's extreme atmo.

"I am good check, over."
"Roger that Deep Six - we will drop the bottom door asap so you can hit pavement the moment we arrive at the beacon."
"Copy."

The Quantum Drive ceased its preparation hum, and the crew was ready, alert, but not tense as the ship pushed through Mkm distances close to the speed of light.

The ship popped out of mad speed levels as quick as she entered it, and the Searcher arrived at Aberdeen.  Quickly, the quantum drive cooled down and spooled up to its final destination - luckily the downed pilot had gone south near a cave, and the major weather was not a concern. The primary concern on this operation was the lack of water remaining in the system of the pilot.

Usually, you would think a pilot would carry enough water and supplies, but unfortunately this time, it was a max range operation for the fighter pilot and there wasn't a lot of room for error in the flight plan. Meaning, when the mission erred, the pilot didn't have everything needed for survival.

So, the idea was to hydrate the pilot, check for any broken bones, and escort them onto the Searcher.  Pirates took down the fighter plane on the wing as it was trying to escape a facility with stolen information, and it was vital to get the pilot and information onto the Searcher before the pirates finished their defensive work.

The gunners stood at the ready to defend the ship and the pilot and rescuer.  Time was of the essence.

The Pirates were on scope and in a search pattern that was taking them near the cave with the pilot.  The pilot had to have walked some distance to get here evading them.  That could mean the pilot was able to self transport.

Deep Six waited for the bottom ramp to open so he could jump out and tend to the pilot.  It slowly lowered, and the rescue agent went to work.  He jumped down and the ship lifted off to fight the pirates.

Six then scanned for the beacon, and then shut it off for security.  The pirates didn't seem to have the technology to eaves drop on the signal, but fewer chances.  The beacon point was saved on Six hud anyway now, and no longer needed.

Finding the downed pilot not too far into the cave was a relief for Six.  He began tending to the pilot. A sprained ankle, cuts and bruises, but the fighter plane had done its job to protect the pilot before self destructing in Aberdeen's atmosphere.  The pilot engaged his flight pack at the last possible moment to evade his predators, and it worked enough for rescue to arrive.

The medgun beam came to life and the pilot started to feel better. Water was had by the pilot, as well as some protein bars. Slowly, he was getting life back into him.  

Above them, the skies lit on fire as the turrets from the Cat pounded through the atmo of Aberdeen. The pirates didn't want to lose their valuable information to NOVA, so they fought hard and didn't back down. Someone wasn't going home today, and NOVA ensured it was the Cutlass Blacks of the Ninetails.

After all was silent a while, the engines of the Sol Searcher were heard over the winds of Aberdeen, then even more wind as it touched down.  

The two planetside wanderers made their way to the ship, and boarded it.  The operative quickly stored his information in the Caterpillars servers, encrypted it, and then went to rest on a cot near engineering.

The engineer removed his gear, swapped into something more comfortable - manned his station - and the ship took off from the moon.

Mission Success.
