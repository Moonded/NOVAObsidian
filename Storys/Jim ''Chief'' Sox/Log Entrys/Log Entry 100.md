Callsign: Jim "Chief" Sox
System: Stanton, Area 18
Location: NOVA HQ

The Commander's badge was posted onto Jim, and today was his first day as a Leader in NOVA.  It came with new responsibilities to his friends and family, and new choices to make.

"You have your charge; would you like to form your own Squadron or what would you like to do with your Commander Posting, Jim?" Came his own thoughts into his head.

Jim thought about all the times he desired to go into that Deep Black Night of unexplored space.  He smiled. "I want to go out there. I want to see things no one has ever seen. I want to meet that midnight darkness with the light of my curious soul, and risk everything in it."

He had trained with military operations, science operations, core operations, and his resume was littered with anything he could think of that could prepare him for that trek.  But could he make it out there; alone; and unsupported?

He could use a MISC Odyssey and refuel his ship as he went, have a Terrapin aboard her for reconnaissance, and go to ground when needed.  He could make it work.  He just needed help to see his vision through. He needed NOVA.

The Chief stood up, refreshed. It was a new day for him. Everything was new. He would ask his friends and his commanders, would they give him a Ship?
