Personal Log : A Return To Darkness

The Herald was disabled. Would a 125a do any better? 

At 20,000km from start point, both ships began to fail. Coincidence? Probably not. This may be the limit of a size 1 component!

Repaired 125a successfully - will attempt to go another 20,000km on current ship. 

The MyddKnight has gone almost as deep into the dark as the Herald had. Let's try to go farther.  Let's try for 47,850,000km before repairs.

NOTE: the errors for the ships are different. The Herald had a cooler malfunction, the 125a major torque imbalance.![[Pasted image 20230712223052.png]]
