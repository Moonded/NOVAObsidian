JOURNAL ENTRY :: JinnSox

Jinn was finally exhausted as the Hammerhead he was working on went into Quantum and left Baijini Point to parts unknown.  However, downtime was not a threat to Jinn as it was Jim, and the young Engineer knew exactly what to do.

He went to MIC L5, and grabbed a beer and some Big Benny's.  Just getting away from the neon and traffic of life and further into the darkness of that deep black made him feel refreshed.

He parked his Stalker at the station, and then rented a Reliant SEN for a pleasure cruise as far out into that midnight as he could get.  One beer, a cup a noodles, and the night.

He spent 3 days out there before he started to crave civilization again. In time, he would be able to spend weeks, months in that blanket of night; but until then, he would go home and get back to work.
