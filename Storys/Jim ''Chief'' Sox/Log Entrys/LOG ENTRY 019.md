Jinn - also known as Jim

Journal Entry :: Promotional Materials

Jinn felt an identity crisis. He didn't feel like himself. It was as if someone else was encroaching on him from within his mind. He couldn't figure it out. Suppressed memories haunted him in his sleep. His migraines were coming on more often, and he was starting to lose sight of his reality.

The only thing that kept his mind alert and feeling 'right' was engineering. Engineering is completely logical in its form and function, and once something behaves a way, so long as it has optimal wear and tear factors, it will behave that way. It soothes Jinn's mind.

"Jim, I need you to report to my office." Said the overwatch command.

"Roger, sir." Jinn replied. Everyone sees him and knows him as his former self - a drunken loner named Jim that hacked into his clone, and created Jinn.  It was maddening for Jinn at times, as his life doesn't feel like its being lived "the way it is supposed to be".

Jinn set down his multi-tool, and reported to the office.

"You called for me, sir?" Jinn asked once he entered into the office.
"You are being promoted and are to report to your Wing Commander at once.. Chief Engineer...." The overwatch commander stated.
"Aye, sir. I will report immediately." Was all Jinn could say. His records had him on Medical as Jinn Sox, but as NOVA Intergalactic personnel file as Jim Sox. It was actually useful at times like this. When he knew that being called as Jim was an Administration reason.  He reported in to <@509117303384965140> and requested an audience.
