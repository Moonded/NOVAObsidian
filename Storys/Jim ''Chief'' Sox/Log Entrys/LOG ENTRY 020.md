Aboard the NSS Southern Cross (Crucible)


"So, as of build 3.17.4 of this Drake Cutter, the last thing we need to test is the VK-00 Quantum Drive.  Any takers?" Jinn asked his recent class of Engineering Assistants.

"Won't that drive stretch the skin on your face like This?!" One of his jokester students offered as she made a horrendous face.

"Indeed! This drive will strip the feathers off a chicken in flight!"  Jinn chimed back. "Alright, I will test it out. You are all  assigned to the Observation Tower. See you in a few lightyears...." Jinn laughed.

The repair bay opened, and 'Chief' took off into that comforting blanket of nothing as the ship disappeared from the viewers.

*Make sure you record this run, as I modified this drive on the Freestar* (Jinn's Endeavor) The comms chatter began.

The students then gathered around the main computer terminal, as Jinn punched the Drive into Action.

"YeeeeeeeeeeHAW!!!!" Was all Chief could say as the ship warped time and space around it and screamed through the stars like a bat outta hell.

Only ten minutes later, the Cutter pulled back into view from seemingly nowhere.

*And that's what a Grade A Milspec drive is capable of. Class Dismissed!* The crackle of the comms ended, and Jinn was free to enjoy this classic hunk of junk on his own.  A telling glint showed in his eye, as he punched the Quantum Drive into its max distance range...
