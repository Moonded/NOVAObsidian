Jim "Chief" Sox

Personal Log :: The Darkness

Out here, there is no threat of piracy, police, law or the unlawful. Out here, it is me and my machine.  In this case, a Drake Herald that will be sending out coordinate data to NOVA.

Jim was home.  In the Darkness.  Pinpoints of light were all around him, a gas cloud falling away behind him enveloping the distant Stanton G-class star.  

And life was quiet. Peaceful. Almost to the sound of the dead gone to dust.

No wind. The hustle and bustle of civilization gone.  Even the engines barely a humm as the Acceleration Limiter was at minimum. Just enough to keep the Herald moving at its max speed of 1,360 m/s - time was the enemy, here.

Time until the shit hit the fan and the ship would fail.

[ERROR: Cooler Reduction]

The ZeroRush cooler kept the hyrdrogen usage down, but it wasn't tuned for long duration flight, and it was failing.  This was not exactly a part of the test of this flight, but it proved that durability of your components mattered.

Time went by - Jim moved power off the grid, cooled off the engines, kept the ship going while it broke under the stress.

47,819,000km his Comms Array for the ship lost power and failed. 

[ERROR: Cooler Failure... Cooler Failure... Cooler Failure]

After the third error code, all power was lost to the ZeroRush cooler, and Jim's Herald was disabled. Not even at 25% hyrdrogen fuel used, but that was the test - how much Hydrogen the Herald would burn over what amount of time in this configuration.  What data can it send back to NOVA, and what would Jim find out here?

47,822,290km away, and the PowerPlant, Thrusters, and two Mains were all that was left working on the ship. The MFD's were still lit, but it could only limp any further.

Jim called for assistance, and NOVA came to his rescue. Mission Complete.![[Pasted image 20230712223107.png]]
