LOG ENTRY 002: Jim Sox

Quartermaster: "You wil be assigned to the ARIES Squadron, and I see you have a special request for 3 Ghosts?"

Jim: "Yessir, each is specially adapted for various environments, have the Long Look Radar and Tracker Components, and ballistic cannons to run silent."

Quartermaster: "We don't get a lot of requests for ballistics, you sure?"

Jim: "Yessir - I am not a combatant if I can help it, but if necessary I will fight."

Quartermaster: "Very well. And your Uniforms are in your locker, but you also have a special operational outfit request?"

Jim: "My plan is to observe and report, and outside the bounds of normal uniforms, I would like this to be my operational outfit."

Quartermaster: "Very good. Here is your Arclight sidearm, your two Arrowhead sniper rifles, one with the A03 8x scope and stabilizer, the other with the Atzkav 16x scope and stabilizer.

Your Avenger Stalker is registered and noted, you are free to fly it with your Squadron.
