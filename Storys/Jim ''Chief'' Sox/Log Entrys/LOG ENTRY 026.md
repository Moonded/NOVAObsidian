RE: Application to join the NSS Cousteau as Communications Officer

Dear Sir -

It has come to my attention that you have an availability on board your exploration vessel. I would gladly like to fulfill the position and prepare payroll, finances, and track our expenditures.

I would also like to form a monthly Newsletter for the ship. Something to boost morale in those deep space doldrums.

My goal is to learn data encryption methods and to understand Signal Interception and Voice Intercept from the console on board.

I hope to join you in your adventures, and I am now free of all obligations!

Thank you for your opportunity and your time,

Sincerely,
Jim Sox

Dear Sir -

Request granted. 

Thank you and well done, Sir.

The Commander tidied up his business and checked over his previous responsibilities one more time, and with a duffel bag as all he owned remaining, clicked off the light to the MIC L2 office of Section 07.

For its brief existence, Jim was proud of his accomplishments; but now there were new adventures awaiting him.

He looked at his new bed on board the *Cousteau*, set his duffel bag down, and began preparing for work on board the Carrack.

As he checked in with medical for the routine regeneration transfer, he was offered something he would always love from this day forward. A spicy hot Big Benny's greeted him as a welcome gift from the CO and crew. He set his Cruz Lux down, and took the ramen noodles to the mess hall.

Everyone was there to say hello, and Jim realized then and there that this was his new home, and these people? They were gonna be some of the closest friends over his time in NOVA than anyone. They were about to see the Verse together from the bridge of this mighty starship!
