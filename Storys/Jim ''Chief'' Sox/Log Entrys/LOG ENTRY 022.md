Jim Sox - Personal Log
"An Old Girlfriend"

It had been a rocky relationship.  The Lady Jaye was constantly a work in progress and Jim had almost given up on her five times or so now. He doesn't remember the day he got the Constellation Taurus, he just remembered that it was something unique from the very beginning.

So he made it a pet project. He was going to master craft this vessel.

He poured in hours upon hours of free time into the ship. It had taken him on expensive dates out to the far reaches of the galaxy to get parts for it, and test those parts, and then? Remove them again.

He was on iteration 157 of the ship after 3 years of work, and he felt like he had just started with it.

What weapons? What engines? What shields? What is the BEST of the Best?  A Constellation is an icon, its not just any old ship of the line - these vessels? They bore the very spirit of space flight within the view of their struts.

Jim had to do it just right. Over and above anything he had every done.

And he was finished.  This Lady Jaye MK CVIX is the One.  He poured over the data again and again - yes - all parts worked together at their peak efficiencies. Everything was just as it should be.

He looked over the lines of the ship - felt the way she moved in space flight - enjoyed the fight she had in combat - and finally felt a total sense of peace over his work.  He loved this ship - she was his Old Girl.  Maybe not his first love, but his best love.
