"Jinn's Theme"

The void of her minds eye needed something for expression. It was silent, hungry, and in need.  Jinn sought through hundreds of musical soundbytes from all over the Verse, and nothing spoke to him, until he did a random search from Sol.  The human music there held ancient recordings from before space flight, and Jinn resonated with them.

And then he found it, something that spoke with how he felt about himself, his past, and his future.  My Life, by Billy Joel. It was archaic, but it sounded like the musician was experiencing the life of a clone.

"I don't need you to worry for me cause I'm alright...
I don't want you to tell me its time to come home."

"I don't care what you say anymore this is my life...
Go ahead with your own life, leave me alone!"

That chorus rang true for Jinn and all the thoughts he had rolling in his head.  Sure, maybe it wasn't a perfect translation of what Jinn was going through, but it fit his moods just fine.

And so, Jinn made peace with his previous imprints and memories, and put them in the silent spaces of forgetfulness. The skills he used would complement him, but the people that gave him those skills are lost to time.
