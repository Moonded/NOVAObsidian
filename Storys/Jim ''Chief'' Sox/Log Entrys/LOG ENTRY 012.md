Jinn didn't only inherit memories from two previous lives, he also inherited corporate stock, items, vehicles, personal effects, and tools from them. Deep within all of that was a custom Avenger Stalker that Jim used.  A Prisoner Transport, Jinn wondered why he couldn't remember much about the ship.  

To that fact, Jinn couldn't remember very much from his host account whatsoever. Whoever that original template was or whatever he did was a mystery to Jinn.  Deep in his memories, he remembered the joy and thrill of exploring deep space, and the silent emptiness that surrounded him in peace as he did so.  That was it, it replayed in his mind whenever he tried to think of who he was or where he came from.

Just.. empty silences.

But if you put him in front of a console - he moved through engineering with extreme skill. No thought only action. He was a natural. He didn't know how he learned to do it or where the capabilities came from, but when ARIES needed him to perform a task it was as natural as breathing.

So - Jinn had an Avenger Stalker in his account.  What would he be doing with a police transport?
And then Jinn's world lit up, and his first Aura Migraine hit. Not knowing what it was, Jinn reeled in pain, and the world was alight with rainbows and madness.  He took a Demexatrine dose, and the engineer calmed back down.  That was enough sifting through his memories for one day.

The next day, Jinn reported to medical. 

"You are suffering from something called an Aura Migraine. Probably instigated during your recent cloning process.  After thousands of years, there is still no cure for this - but the Demexatrine injectors will help subdue your symptoms.  I will need to run scans, and you will have to report regularly to this office for check ups.  This could show an abnormality in your genetics."

"An 'abnormality'?" Jinn hesitated, remembering the hell of his creation, and it triggered a system wide response.  

The doctor noted the paleness on Jinn, the sudden sweat, the look of pure pain on his face, and decided right there to run some tests. "This could be a symptom of something else, I need to run some samples."  He took out his medgun and began scanning Jinn. "That will do, I will put these results into our database, and reference it with your imprint."

"Thank you..." Jinn was breathless as he went back to work for ARIES.
