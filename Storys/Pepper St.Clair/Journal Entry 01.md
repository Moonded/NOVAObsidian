**The screen would come to life with the dull flickering of a woman sitting at a table, a protein bar and a drink in front of her.** 


“Exhausted!. Today was a full day of loading and unloading cargo, another day another dollar as they used to say.. I’ve been spending a good deal of time alone, not that I really have too many complaints about that. I guess I finally decided to start making entries into the ship’s database with the hope I can look back on this with nostalgia, it’s not every week I can bring in half a million doing shipping contracts.  

[[Crusader Industries]] put out a rather juicy request for medical supplies during a blockade of one L1. Gave the [[Ninetails]] a run for their money while they were occupied with the defending forces.
Half a million aUEC in three days and I nearly lost the majority of it when someone in a C2 mistook my craft for a landing pad crushing my aft port side engine severely, damaging my ship. During the encounter I was thrown and nearly died as a result of the pilot’s carelessness.

Upon waking I was winded and required medical attention, so I bandaged myself up as best I could while my mangled craft sat idle blasting sparks and leaking jets of water from the plumbing. Battery banks were cracked and my living quarters in complete and total disarray. 
The [[icy lunar regolith]] of [[Cellin]] had a pretty substantial number of parts and components from my ship and the [[C2 Starlifter]] smashing hard into the ground.
I managed to ease myself into the pilot's chair before doing an emergency take off under harsh conditions. Fortunately I was able to disable the engine coupling and ride her out to orbit under an extreme torque imbalance. I can’t say I was too impressed arriving back at L1. with damaged and destroyed cargo only to find out I had a crime stat for something I didn’t do. 

I can’t begin to ask myself where I came up with the idea, however surrendering to [[Hurston’s security]] services was not the worst thing to ever think of, slipping down onto the planet’s surface wouldn't be easy, I flew in low and slow then waited at the loading area inside of [[Teasa spaceport]] waiting for a cargo vessel to take off and I simply slipped in, shut down and waited for a moment before disembarking from the nearly crippled spacecraft. 

Security was waiting for me on the pad, I don’t blame them for being angry but better In custody with a hefty fine than dead in the expanse of space over 9600 boxes of smashed and broken medical supplies. Perhaps not my proudest moment lowering the ramp with my hands up while kneeling on the deck plate with broken bones and cardiovascular distress from the sudden shock to my poor body. 

I collapsed and woke up some time later having been treated by emergency medical services.
A head full of drugs could never have prepared me for what happened next!. I was arrested and held in the star port customs area for ten hours while they questioned me. Eventually I was let off the hook with a reasonable warning. Moral of the story? You can’t be too careful where you park your ship!. Outside of a fine for a parking violation I was allowed to keep my pilots license and continue as normal. 

Repairs were complete and the installation of a new X1 Jump drive made up for the rough time
