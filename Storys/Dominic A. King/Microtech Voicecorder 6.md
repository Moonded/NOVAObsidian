With some of my old slum friends I managed to fortify at my old home. It is still abandoned. Everything is like I left it behind. Kinda ironic that it ends where it all started. Nova is already here and raiding the base. Our first two lines of defense failed. Their landing crafts already landed and the marines got deployed. I guess that's the end.
