Today was the funeral of my dad. [[Macbeth]], who is now the Executive of a small mining company in the [[Nyx]] system, came all the way to [[Cellin]]. It was very emotional. We buried him near the outpost. [[Tram and Myers]] fired all of us after this accident. They even abandoned the whole outpost and built a new one only 20 kilometers away. Still can't believe it... Because it was "cheaper"... Still don't know what to do now...
