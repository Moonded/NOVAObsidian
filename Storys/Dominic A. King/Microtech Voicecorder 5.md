Today might be the greatest day in my life. Today I was promoted to the rank of a commander. [[Macbeth]] and all of the old crew came from all the corners of the verse. I think I even saw [[Schmidt]] lurking somewhere in the crowd. After the ceremony we went to the closest bar and celebrated the whole night long. I wish my dad was here to see that but I am pretty sure he is proud of me.
