Is this thing still working? The red light is blinking so I guess it does... Sooo where to start? The last two years sucked. I lived in the slums of [[ArcCorp]], the one near [[Area 22]]. A very harsh place to live. I made some friends. They might be not the most lawful ones but they safe my life several times. They found me after I was stabbed the third time. It's not easy to survive in the slums but I somehow made it. [[Schmidt]] told me he found a job offer for both of us. You wouldn't believe how surprised I was when he showed me the leaflet: _[[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA INTERGALACTIC]] RECRUITING_
I am on my way to dress up for the interview... I really don't know what to expect
