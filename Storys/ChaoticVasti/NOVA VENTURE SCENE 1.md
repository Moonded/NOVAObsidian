NOVA VENTURE SCENE 1
Callsign: [[ChaoticVasti]]
Location: Moon [[Wala]]

Scene brief from episode 1:

My concern over habitable planets and the ever growing demand for sustainable food consumption and breathable atmospheres, has driven me to strive for new developments in fauna and flora, this taking my childhood experiences into consideration, and vowing to be a pillar of positive change for humanity. After one of my most recent botanical expeditions, [[Tido]], my space Ferret learnt of a long-lost colony of Space Ferrets located somewhere in the [[Oretani]] system or surrounding starsâ€¦ While [[Tido]] urgently wanted to take a new expedition to [[Oretani]], my more urgent project was to study the plant and genetically engineer a new sub species capable of growing in more varied atmospheric conditions. After having created a sample of the new bio-engineered seed, my plans were to start the cultivating process in [[Stanton]] on at [[Wala]] farm, one of the moons of ArcCorp. Knowing the importance that this was to do on my part, [[Tido]] pleaded to borrow the [[Endevour]] with accompanied biodomes to go and find the colony and see how he could save some of his fellow species. Reluctantly I agreed and gave a final hug to my most trusted companion as he set off on his very personal goal. In the interim, I found myself spending a lot of time at the farm with a focused energy to see my new species of superior plant take root and adapt to the climate of Wala.
This will be an amazing new step forward for engineering fauna for planet terraforming for humanity. 

*and so my story begins*

Squad entry
Callsign: [[ChaoticVasti]]
Location: Habitat in [[Area18]]

As I read through possible recruitments to squads I found what I thought to be a good one... First Contact. They seemed to be right up my alley and I start to eagerly filled in the application form. Okay great! I can't wait to send this through they seemed to be one of the few squads interested in exploring the first of new systems. After all I still need to find that damn ferret with my Endeavour... it seems like a perfect place to start. Besides my unfortunate mishap needing to be rectified they are also in need of a science and research officer, or at least people who know what they're doing. 

Upon further research of this squad I noticed a slight detail... oh... an old flame seems to be the commander. So how the heck to get past this. It was a good lay hopefully he remembers the encounter too. 

READS APPLICATION: REASON YOU'LL BE A GOOD FIT FOR THE SQUAD?

Hmmmm... let me think...besides my obviously impressive CV.

*Slept with the boss it was good maybe we do it again sometime*
