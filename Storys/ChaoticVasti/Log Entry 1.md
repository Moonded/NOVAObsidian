How do you start a story without a truly definitive beginning. How do you start describing childhood, friends and growing up when it all feels like a dream rather than a memory... when phases of life feels like a lifetime apart, a past life long since lived and forgotten. Truly how and where does one start expressing who you are... and how have you come to be??

I guess for me its easier to describe my "past life" a daughter of a wealthy hardworking man who has ensured his little girl wants for nought. Spoiled? Maybe... but still raised to be humble though even she cant resist bragging on her own accomplishments. 

Who is she now? Who is she in this life? Her family fortune stems from profits of mining colonies... dirty and all destroying. So she vowed to live a life of rebuilding, replenishing resources and restoring the natural ways back to how the universe intended to be. 

So who is she? She is reborn as [[ChaoticVasti]]... zoologist,botonist and environmental buff supreme... okay maybe not supreme but hey no one's perfect. This is the not so humble part of me remember? Writing this log in the third person and then thought... why am I always this serious? Life is short and as already explained phases feel like lifetimes. Quite frankly recently ,moving in on my new lifetime, it's time for a change... time to be more... more than I ever was before... this is my beginning.
