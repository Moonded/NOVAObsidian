Swoosh ‘Welcome to the exercise area’ came from the ships computer as the doors opened.

Walking through the doors I take a look around and notice several other people. But no familiar faces from my unit.  

I popped up the holographic interface as soon as I took my stand on the training mat and with a few hand gestures the computer once again spoke to me ‘Initiating fighting sequence 4, good luck!’. I can not help but see a smirk on that damn computer while hearing ‘good luck’. The attack came fast as was intended by the simulation after putting me off guard by the wishes the computer made. I had no time to face the direction from which the attack came but that was not necessary as I located the sound coming from the device. Tsjoeee, it was a close one but I was able to graciously dodge. Meanwhile I returned my own salvo of punches and one last thought went through my mind.

‘I will put up a new high score’

As I really want to beat the [[Commander]]’s score this time!  

The simulation ended and here I am sitting on my knees, exhausted and my adrenaline rapidly diminishing. While I was staring into no where listening to the sound of my sweat dripping on the mat I missed the person sneaking up to me. An arm wrapped around my throat and before I know it I am pinned down. How did I not see or hear him coming?  

‘Men, must be hard to lose twice, once to the commander his high score and to me not able to get out of my choke’ was whispered into my ear. It was Arch, luckily for me as I did not have the strength to break free in case someone really attacked me. [[ArchangelCorps]] released his hold and gave me a hand to pull me up. Arch who is also a pretty new recruit to our unit is also often to be found exercising when most of the ship is asleep. We trained together which helped us bond and get to know each other better. Still he did not spill everything yet, like how the heck does he always know how to sneak up on everybody. When I was a kid the [[UEE]] found me as a stray and trained my into an asset specialised in stealth and solo survivability. But his level is beyond the skill level the [[UEE]] could ever reach. The other part he keeps quiet about are his nightmares which keeps him up at nights…  

While we were walking through the corridors discussing which drink we would start with at the bar both our MobiGlass lit up Beep Beep, Beep Beep. Looking at each other with a strange look as apparently the commander is requesting our presence, which is strange considering the ship time.

Maybe it has something to do about the Orphanage, I heard other [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] members went investigating which made me put aside my worries. Or maybe the commander got word about our needs elsewhere and we are getting the hell out of this shit system. Arch and I took a left turn instead of going right towards the bar which we really wanted to and went to see the Commander.
