So we finally returned ‘home’ a couple of days ago, it steel feels weird to call this city my new home.  But as I came back to a society and world which is unfamiliar to me I guess I can manage one more decision made by someone else for me. As the commander treats us well, I placed my trust in him picking a place to call home. Arch and his wife took me out for dinner, which was great as well. Never imagined I would forget the taste of a good steak. I am glad my squad accepts me so well, socializing and getting back into living is something I really want now I am not bound to my dad and his colleagues ambitions.  

Unfortunately I do need to confront my dad one last time before I can set myself completely free. [[Dr. Stevens]] told me this would be my last step to take before I can fully start this new life. It took me two goddam years to get here, finally I can say it are dreams in which he comes forth instead of nightmares  keeping me up all night. The inhibitor on my sphere helped me digest all those memories I have of my previous life one by one. If everything goes well upon removal of the inhibitor I should also regain some of my abilities which I had trained into my subconscious. But it will also ‘release’ some more memories on the [REDACTED] project and associated departments which some people in the UEE believe to have survived the downfall of the Messer era. So does that mean the [[UEE]] only helps me because I can possibly be of value to them? Something I should not dwell on to much for now.  

As soon as I broke free of my thoughts I noticed it was starting to rain, not to hard, but softly the cold drops fell down on my face. A refreshing feeling and suddenly my two hour walk did not seem so bad in comparison to that tin can we were in for 6 months touring through the pyro system. But as I felt my stomach rumbling I knew it was time to get some food and maybe a nice pint of beer to wash it all down. Upon entering a bar I imagined this could be a nice spot to hang out with the boys as well.  

After a bit of food and a couple of drinks I was ready to hit the bed, hopefully the concierge fixed the light switch as I will not tolerate another night sleeping with a light up in my face….

As I walk back I was not sure my mind was playing tricks on me or not, I felt like being watched but could not spot anyone tailing me. Well just a couple of days till that inhibitor comes off and I will be ready for anyone again.
