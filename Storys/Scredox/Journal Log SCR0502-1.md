It is strange to open my journal log… It has been 3 months since I joined the ranks within [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]]. [[Commander]] [[Bandader]] saw potential in me and added me to his squad the Catulan Reavers.

Although the [[Commander]] had urged me to log my feelings and thoughts after training and missions I did not do so up until now…

We were in the mess eating when the [[Commander]] walked in with a grim look on his face. Before we could even ask what was going on the story was coming out of the Commanders mouth. A story clearly not suitable for one person to carry. A story which affects us all…

Apparently [[Admiral]] [[Dolbi]] sent out a message across the [[NOVA Frontier|Frontier]] and [[NOVA Defence|Defence]] divisions. ‘Something shady is going on at a place called [[the Orphanage]] on [[Lyria]]’. My first thought was that some bunch of thief's were being funny to call it [[the Orphanage]] to recruit new meat to their ranks.

But than the [[Commander]] said the words ‘Children’ and ‘bad’, all other words blurred out in that moment and the looks on everybody’s faces became filled with anger or sadness.

After the [[Commander]] was done we all left the mess silently or mumbling to our personal quarters or some other private part of the ship.

Now here I am, writing about it. Not sure what to do as the [[Commander]] decided to remain on our current mission. A mission already putting us on edge since we are into dangerous parts of space. And for what? Some precious left over space rocks which had to be mined for the big corporations funding the [[UEE]] and in turn us as well.  While a bunch of children are possibly getting harmed or used by tugs for activities which never end well.

Lets hope either something happens over here to take my mind off the matter or we receive an update about the situation at [[Lyria]] making the [[Commander]] decide to abort this mission prematurely.

Time to blow of some steam in the gym, guess no one will be there in the middle of the night…
