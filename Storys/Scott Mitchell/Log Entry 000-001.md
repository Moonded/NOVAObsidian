"This is Day One of being part of [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]]. I was invited maybe 4 days ago and just accepted the invite today. I wish I saw it sooner but the people are pretty awesome!" Some chatter is in the background where he gets his ship, "Alright getting my ship here.... why does this shit take so long?" Various tapping and beep sounds happen and then a female voice says something and he starts walking, "Alright... Hangerrrr.... four. There we go." The elevator makes noises going to its position and he arrives to the Hanger, "ahhh there we are! My Aurora... looks beautiful as ever. I'm going to try and... whoops!" A loud thud noise rings out, "Dropped my phone...." More noises come from him and he gets his phone..., "Alright lets start this thing..." he taps a few buttons then a boom is heard..., "FUCK. I blew an engine..." he sighs in defeat and he goes to fix the engine.
