-- AUDIO START --

"Alright! Its been quite awhile since I was here. I have been here home on [[New Babbage]] for the last 3 months because I met some people to chill with. I am walking to the Terminal now actually just need to pass Security." Loud footsteps and various voices sound and digitized scanning. "Alright! I am getting my ship to get deployed again into my garage..."

-- VIDEO START--

Frost types out his details on the deployment pad trying to get his [[Aurora]] deployed and the Pad kept sending in errors. "Come on you shit..." He kept trying to deploy it and it eventually works and tells him to go to Hanger 2. "Finally. Goddamn." He walks to one of the elevators and sends himself to the Hanger. "There you are. Last time I worked on you, you exploded on me. Lets see if you work now..." He walks to the ship and enters, "I don't miss this ship all that much but it is what it is." He starts the ship, "Alright... everything looks good." The ship starts sputtering, "No no no! Don't you dare do that you sack of-" The ship blows the engine and the ship hits the Hanger floor.

Loud coughing came from it, "Well... I guess I need more repairs. Ow I think I dislocated something." Loud bone cracking sounds out, " OW... got it in place. Alright time to start fixing this thing..." He sighed, " This isn't going to be fun."
