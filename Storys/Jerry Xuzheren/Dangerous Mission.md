Dangerous Mission

By [[Jerry Xuzheren]]

June 10 Saturday 2953, [[MicroTech]], [[Ghost Hollow]], [[Stanton]]

Above the sky of [[MicroTech]], it was blue as the sea, with the endless space above. What a nice day, but I couldn’t feel any sense of relax, I was nervous. Because there would have a big war soon.

I sat inside my M2, flying across the atmosphere, with a [[Centurion]] loaded inside the cargo bay. And I was going to deploy it on [[Ghost Hollow]] later, we were going to hold the place for 12 hours. Complete the mission, that was the only thing I knew. 

The relic became more and more clear as I approached. I could even saw the ground crew; they were wearing black suit and Armor. They also saw me; and a hand gesture was everything we need to confirm each other’s identity. 

“[[A103]], [[Xuzheren]], request for landing.” I gave them a hand gesture.

“[[A103]], Xu… whatever that call, identity confirm, landed on the designated area.” He said, followed with a gesture which told me where to land.

They always misspelt my name, and it was so common for me. Almost everyone would misspell my name, but that wasn’t the case. With the direction, I landed beside the relic, and open the cargo bay…
The work was done pretty soon, [[the Centurion]] was out and placed at right location. My work was done, I went back inside my M2 and requested for leaving.

“A103, [[Xuzheren]], request for leaving.”

“A103, ok I get you, you can leav…”

He wasn’t finish talking, when I saw an energy ball flew pass the sky, toward me, and an explosion… I lost control to M2, it crashed straight to the ground. Dust and dirt block the light, everything blur out.
That was so quick, I didn’t even have time to react. When I finally notice what happened, everything already ended. They already got that guy who shot me with rail gun. Luckily, my M2 didn’t explode on that crash, but one engine was complete dead when I check it. 

“Don’t worry, he is tough enough to make the way back to [[Port Tressler]].” He said…
