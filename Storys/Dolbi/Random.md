It’s a nice day on [[ArcCorp]], or at least as nice as it can get on this corrupt corporate heaven. The [[Advocacy]] does a terrible job at keeping the area secure and prefers intimidating workers into compliance. The [[Civilian Defense Force]] regularly has to intervene when private security is unable to manage the various pirates and drug dealers in the area.  

Ever since [[NOVA Intergalactic]] has established their base of operation on [[ArcCorp]], for ease of access to medical facilities and proximity to popular commercial hubs, security in the region has seen a major increase, and even though [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]]’s [[Defense Forces]] have noticed a steep rise in pirate activities, the corporate leadership has jumped on the opportunity to boast increased safety for the “law” abiding citizens, thanks to [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] dealing with threats in the sector where the Advocacy failed to respond.  

[[Admiral]] [[Dolbi]] has been quite busy in the last few months, keeping tabs on a variety of ventures the Frontiers Branch can explore, establishing a proper structure for the exploration department and following up on the StarMap’s data.  

Along with his regular responsibilities, he also recently took interest in suspicious activities from what seemed to be a group of drug smugglers at first sight. Normally, such things are handled from contracts handed out by the various sectors’ security departments, but one in particular seems to have gone under the radar, a group employing children in a facility they called “[[The Orphanage]]”.  

It ended up being a front for a major drug smuggling operation, bigger than any small fry narcotics heist the regular would-be outlaws usually venture into. A team went on to investigate and reported a much larger organization acting behind the scenes, big enough to send [[NOVA Marines]] to the hospital and even capture an operative investigating the case.

[[NOVA ADMIRAL|NOVA’s Admiralty]] has authorized the formation of a [[Special Task Force]] to look into the matter and put an end to it before it takes immeasurable proportions.  

Led by [[Wing Commander]] [[Bandader Arten]], [[Task Force Azrael]] has tracked an individual codenamed “[[Malachite]]”, and is currently gathering intelligence on his whereabouts and security personnel.  

From his makeshift office in [[Area 18]], [[Dolbi]] called upon a meeting with the officers in charge of the Investigation, [[BandaderArten]] and [[Cepheus]], [[ArchangelCorps]] was unavailable, gathering intelligence on the suspects at that moment.  

Hands joined, fingers crossed and resting his chin on top of his raised indexes, [[Dolbi]] greeted the 2 men and, without changing his posture, went straight to the point, as is his usual fashion.  

”Alright guys, I’m impressed by the work you’ve done so far, though I have to admit, getting incarcerated at [[Klesher]] was an administrative mess on my end, all of [[Stanton]]’s private securities asked me to vouch for your honesty and goodwill, I had a multitude of paper to send to the various offices and outposts to get your records cleaned. The [[UEE]] was especially hard to fend off, asking to put you on probation before you can accept further contracts from the [[CDF]]. Let’s just try and stay out of prison in the future…”  

After a quick glance at the holographic clock, giving the time on each of the system’s planets and moons, the [[Admiral]] didn’t let anyone voice an excuse and continued on.  

”That being cleared, I’m eager to know where we’re standing with the whole situation. Have you guys managed to find [[Malachite]]? Do you know anything about his security detail? Is he acting on the orders of a bigger player? What do we know so far?”
