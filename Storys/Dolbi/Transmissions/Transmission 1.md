INCOMING TRANSMISSION

You hear the tingling sound of your [[MobiGlass]] calling to you. Before you have time to raise your arm and see who it is, you can already hear the [[Frontiers]]' [[Admiral]]'s voice.  

"Good morning, or day, or whatever. If you receive this call, I need you for a special investigation."  

You can see the serious but concerned look on the Admiral's face, calling from the lounge of [[The Abyssal Goose]], his favored [[Star Runner]], you can notice the bookshelf behind has been rattled, probably in a bout of anger.  

"I've received a few concerned calls from citizens around Stanton. Apparently, there is some shady activity going on on [[Lyria]], [[ArcCorp]]'s moon. A supposedly charitable organization are running what they call an [[Orphanage]], apparently they help children who lost their parents because of [[Xenothreat]]'s incursions in [[Stanton]]."  

The [[Admiral]] pauses for a second, visibly making efforts to keep his composure. 

"The reports I'm getting from a few people who took interest in helping these children is concerning, to say the least. There is no way to clearly identify the administrators or managers of that apparent [[Orphanage]]. The number they provide to contact them can not be reached, and let's be honest, [[Lyria]] isn't a suitable place to take care of children."

The Admiral's face now went from concerned to grim, he takes a long sip from a water bottle before going on, not before letting out a long sigh.  

"As for the children, the few brave citizens who dared to investigate themselves on [[Lyria]]... Well, they didn't see any children and were promptly told to "F&$ Off" by a heavily armed man some 15km away from the Orphanage. You'll agree with me that this kind of behaviour is suspicious, to say the least."

"I need you to investigate that [[Orphanage]], or what passes to be one, at least. Be ready tho, things could be pretty grim in there, steady your heart and soul. The children being taken there are very real and something is happening to them, I will not allow the most vulnerable individuals of our society to be forgotten because their parents valiantly gave their lives to protect Stanton."  

"While you are at it, see if there is any connection with [[Xenothreat]], we've had numerous altercations with small forces who remained in the system to disrupt economical activities and bolster their support for a potential 3rd assault, if we can hinder their progress even a little, I'll be happy."  

"I leave the matter in your hands now and will be waiting for your report, fly safe out there and find some partners to come with you if you can"  

The [[Admiral]] looks away at a display screen in his ship, something else has now caught his attention...  

"Hmm, [[Dolbi]] out..."
