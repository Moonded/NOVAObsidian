We arrive on site within the established timeframe. Once arrived, we deployed for scouting duties. [[LGxNormandy]], [[Lorax]] and Myself took some ground on the right while [[Nazvegnya]] and [[Broggyr]] took the left. We eventually reached the outskirts of Deakins Outpost when our vehicle got targeted by unknown attackers. We barely had enough time to jump out of the Cyclone before it got blown to bits. Unfortunately we got injured by the deflagration and had to be brought back to our medical units for treatment. [[Broggyr]] risked his life alone to carry us back to camp and treat our injuries. _(Note: Recommend [[Broggyr]] for Medal)._

We eventually managed to regroup with the team at Assault Point B. Some unexpected events made our approach known to the enemy so we changed plans. Alpha was to take on their base head on and Bravo was to circle around with the Ballista. Lorax and I got assigned to Bravo, and with it, the hazardous way through the icy mountains of [[Yela]] with the Ballista. -- Navigation proved particularly difficult the higher we went, but after some time, we managed to spot their base camp, the iconic [[Anvil Carrack]] that served as their [[HQ]] easily spotted in the middle of a ravine formed by multiple slopes and mountains.

Once we were in position, team Alpha was already engaged, we trietaking up a vantage point to assist them, but rolled over unstable terrain the ballista barrelled down a hill to get stuck between 2 rocks. Namount of effort could bring it back on its wheels and we were forced tabandon it where it was, its fire superiority lost in the most ridiculous way.

Lorax and I took to our feet, we were close, and the objective was attainable even on foot at this point. He approached the Carrack from the front as I went around the high ground and hugged the mountain's walls. 

A first engagement between Lorax and an enemy broke out, he couldn't get the best of Lorax and eventually lost the engagement. We made sure there was no other threat around the Carrack and made our way to the last reported position of our objective, the [[Cutlass Red]].

On the way to the cutlass, we encountered another hostile, [[Lorax]] could take him out once again without too much effort. We then proceed to clear both Cyclones that were on site to make sure we wouldn't get stabbed in the back.

Right when the [[Cutlass Red]] was in sight, a hidden hostile sprung out of his position and shot Lorax down, I was too slow to save him, but managed to take down his aggressor with my pistol, had to unload 2 mags to get through his heavy Armor plates, but 2 full mags of a ballistic heavy pistol's concentrated fire will take down even the most armoured soldier.

Being the only remaining operative to fulfil this mission, I didn't hesitate or lose time to scout around, once I made sure my target was down for the count, I darted to the ship, closed the bay door, jumped in the pilot's seat and took off.

**Mission was a success, but the body count is way too high.**
