**Admiral [[Dolbi]]**

/Admiralty has received a call from the CDF. They are overwhelmed by [[Xenothreat]] and receiving various civilian distress calls around [[MicroTech]]. 
//The most recent distress signal was caught a couple hundreds KM away from [[Port Tressler]]. 
//A civilian high profile tourist ship was hijacked by [[Xenothreat]] thugs and they are asking for ransom. Most likely this is an attempt at funding their cause. 
//NOVA has been tasked with assisting the UEEN by handling such situations.

//NOVA Defence being occupied on the front lines at INS-Jericho, they are unable to provide forces and crafts for an extended period, thus we can only afford to Drop operatives, it will be up to them to find a way back to the ground.
//The success of the missions coming down to the infiltration and ability to adapt in order to extract, the job fell on the [[RAVENS]].

//Admiral [[Dolbi]] mustered a team, along with 2 [[RAVENS]] from his own team. C.I.T [[FapaPelsen]] and Scout [[Asherk]]
Full Team: Admiral [[Dolbi]] C.I.T. [[FapaPelsen]] [[Asherk]] [[Maclunkey]] [[BlackRise1]] [[zabka]] [[NickVanGuard_327]]
Dropship Pilot: [[CrimsonHawk93]]

//Team departed from [[Port Tressler]] aboard an [[Esperia Prowler]]. Full combat arsenal. 
//Arrived on site, there was no hostile escort, [[Xenothreat]] doesn't seem to have planned for a rescue. 
//Team dropped on [[890J]]'s Starboard side and proceed to clear the area on the top floors under [[FapaPelsen]]'s command. 
//Bottom floor was cleared after, but [[BlackRise1]] Fell to enemy fire, we could stabilize him but he would have to be taken back for treatment.

//The hangar was fortunately loaded with a functional [[Origin 300i]]. 
//After some issues with the [[890J]]'s elevators (most likely [[Xenothreat]] sabotage), the whole team boarded the [[300i]] after Admiral [[Dolbi]] shot the hangar doors open with his [[CODA Pistol]].
//Shortly after getting out of the big ship’s hangar, Adm. [[Dolbi]] received a call from a familiar contact (Scotty, if anyone knows him from previous stories). 
//Scotty informed Adm. [[Dolbi]] that he had received a tip about a possible bunker occupied by [[XenoThreat]] forces. Could be a resupply or forward base for them to plan their incursion.

//Knowing Defence was still stretched too thin for such a mission, Adm. [[Dolbi]] decided it would be up to this team to investigate. 
//[[BlackRise]] was dropped at [[Port Tressler]] for treatment, he would later join back the team with his fighter.

//Arrived on site, the Bunker’s defence turrets started shooting at the [[300i]], confirming the presence of hostiles in the vicinity. 
//Adm. [[Dolbi]] called the team to open the door and prepare for a hot drop. Under turret’s fire, the team managed to jump out of the ship with minor injury, apart from [[Maclunkey]] who broke a leg and couldn’t follow. _(Note to send compensation)_ 
//The [[Origin 300i]] being unflyable after taking too much fire, Adm. [[Dolbi]] decided to scuttle it, erase all traces of [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] using it, and follow behind fire team inside the bunker. 
//Under [[FapaPelsen]] ‘s command, the team infiltrated the bunker and cleared out all opposition. //In the meantime, defence’s [[CrimsonHawk93]] managed to find us in order to pick the team up.
//Back at [[Port Tressler]] for some R&R, the whole team received a priority message to send reinforcements to INS-Jericho to repel a [[XenoThreat]]’s assault.

//This time, no subtlety was required. The team board a Hammerhead and made their way to INS-Jericho, Adm. [[Dolbi]] in the pilot’s seat.

//Once on site, 2 [[Idrises]] were engaged with civilians of the CDF, but the fight was clearly at a standstill.

//NOVA’s [[Hammerhead]] joined the fray and drew the fire of [[Xenothreat]]’s frigate, taking a hard Railgun hit on its bow, withering the hit.

//After a couple minutes of fire exchange, both frigates were down and peace was back in the area, for now.
