_**Reconnaissance Mission, 2950-08-XX, [[Daymar]]**_

When my alarm clock rang that morning, I was still deep in slumber, caught in a dream, the kind you don’t want to wake up from, the one you wake up from...unsatisfied.

No matter how much you try to keep your eyes shut, with a slim hope that you will manage to catch one last glimpse of those mysterious visions, they slip away.

You know, as soon as you wake up, that the more you try to think about this dream, the more it fades out, leaving only vague and blurry memories of what it was.

The only thing you can do is cling to the last feelings you can remember living while you were in this imaginary world, you have to let the rest go, and accept that it is over, that there are more important matters to attend to.

- - -
As such, very important matters needed to be attended to, [[NOVA Intergalactic]], one of the most influential organisations in this part of the ‘verse, my home and family, has come under the attacks of a group of hackers.

Not only that, but their recent attacks have unleashed a dangerous virus in one of our laboratories, a virus which could very much still be travelling around the Stanton system as I am writing those very lines.

[[High Command]] has asked [[Frontiers]] pilots, the best explorers we can muster, to scout for their base of operations. We know it is on [[Daymar]], and we know they are operating from an underground facility, but that’s it.

We had pinpointed Cave Gamma on [[Daymar]] to be their base of operation, but it was everything except that… Our marines, including Fleet Admiral Tarik, Adm. [[Aingera]] and myself, we got trapped inside the cave, assaulted by these damn pirates, mercenaries by the looks of it, hired to hold us there.

Thanks to the Enforcers and Adm. [[Aingera]]’s field leadership, we survived and managed to get out, but I was wounded during the process.

Adding insult to injury, this trap gave us nothing about the base where they hacked us from, I needed to go back to [[Daymar]], again, and find this damn place, if it was not a cave, maybe a bunker…

As I was going to consult the starmap for coordinates, my access was revoked, I called in tech team, they told me I got hacked, back when I was at the cave, fortunately Sandoval was able to revoke my access to prevent them from doing any harm or to put their hands on sensible data that could put our people in danger.

Even more fortuitous, their intrusion into our systems led me to find out where they could be. By looking at the StarMap’s intel, I could see something had changed, they tried to alter it so I couldn’t use it to find their base, they knew I was near, and they attempted to erase anything that could lead me to them.

Turns out they altered what I was going to look at, I was definitely on the right track.

This time, I was going personally, I wouldn’t let any of my pilots take the risk, especially if my hunch ended up being false.

The big guys at [[NOVA HQ|HQ]] have received information that the hack and bait was actually an attempt at diverting our forces in order to hijack a meeting between High Command and the [[UEE]]. While defense is moving to thwart their efforts, I have another job. (see chapter 10 ⁠events⁠)

The bait might have been a diversion, but the fact remains that we have a bunch of hackers who managed to get access to our network and could do it again, they have to be put down, it’s my duty to find them.

 - - -
Of all the places I could wake up in, [[Lorville]] was probably the one I disliked the most. This filthy place reeks of condescendence and vanity, everyone thinks their the big thing in here, from the big bucks watching down on us citizens from their tower in HD’s headquarters, down to the very drunkard yelling insults at the barmaid, back in the creepiest bar the slums can host.

Don’t get me wrong, sleeping in the slums is no issue, I actually prefer Levski to [[ArcCorp]]’s [[Area 18]] to be honest.

No, it’s the people, they’re all fake, at least in Grim Hex you know everyone wants to kill you, here, they might... or not.

Even as an [[admiral]] of one of the biggest organisations around, I pale in comparison to the VIPs who can afford whole planets and their moons. They are the ones I despise the most, turning planets into whole industries for the sake of their own grandeur, stepping on the victims of their megalomania to stay one step ahead of their competitors at all times.

The sooner I will be out of here, the better I will feel.

- - -
To avoid suspicion, I donned some semi-formal apparels, the look a low-league trader would have. I asked [[Nova Core’s ship department]] for one of those half-beat Freelancers they have in stock, nothing too shabby, but enough cargo space to put a credible load.

The Trade Calculator tells me to get some scrap if I’m going to [[Port Olisar]], to which I’ll stop before going to [[Daymar]] in order to switch ships. About 5000 aUEC worth should be enough to look the part.

No one around looked suspicious, I don’t think I was followed, so I made my way to Hangar 1 and launched out as quickly as I could, almost hitting the bay doors as they were opening, slow doors…

As soon as I got out of Hurston’s atmosphere, I could hear the ringing, my mobi’s VI displayed an incoming message in my visor, “REDUCE VELOCITY”, in red. Good old Hurston Security. Just as I expected.

They hailed at me and announced they were going to scan my ship for illegal goods. As they did, their captain’s face appeared in my mobi’s comm window.

_-”Hi there sir. Just hold on, it won’t be long. So where are you going with this little shipment of scrap there?”_

_-”Oh you know, only a simple run from Lorville to “PO”, they’re always looking for some scrap to repair the docks that keep getting rammed, you know how it is. Then I’ll be on my way to ArcCorp to deliver…”_

_-”Alright! Alright! Zip it. You small league roadsters always love to blabber about how much road you do, alright, be on your way, and no shady trades alright!”_

_-”Thank you! Promise I won’t!...(Idiots)”_


And off I was. Kicked up the quantum engine and lined up to [[Crusader]]. After a few seconds spooling up, calibration followed and the stars became blurs in the static firmament outside the big window of my space truck.

I finally arrived at [[Port Olisar]] a few minutes after reaching [[Crusader]]. There I sold the scrap for a little profit and called Core for recovery of their ship, along with the profit made from the trade as payment.

- - -
With no time to waste, I went to the ship console, and this time, called for my Karthu’al. As it is not listed in our intel, the pirates have no way of knowing I possess one, and if they spot it, they will think it’s some alien-tech lover rich aristocrat touring around [[Daymar]] for some obscure reason.

From my starting navigational marker, I was on the dark side of [[Daymar]], as I had hoped for. It’s not that easy to calculate the timing from Hurston, so I had to leave it to fate a little, guess that one worked out.

After a few minutes navigating at low altitude, I finally got over their base. I stayed at a fairly good distance, enough so that I could zoom in but so that they would not be able to see me. I knew they would have no good reason to scan for intruders, nobody's fool enough to come here at this time…

I touched down about 1000m from the junkyard and got out on foot. It was still dark, I didn’t light my torches. I got to one of the entrances and crept up the old rusty husks of some ships, obviously the result of countless battles and landing/launching accidents.

There was only a single sentry, walking around the whole dump. Either they really thought nobody would ever come, either they don’t care because they’re safe underground, and this guy just serves as a watcher, checking who comes and who goes, and putting back curious onlookers in their place.

Thing is, I was a curious onlooker, so I had better keep it low and avoid him, better not kill him, that would probably prompt some response if he has to keep contact with his [[NOVA HQ|HQ]].

I moved around the whole place while staying out of the sentry’s gaze. Even when the sun got up, no one came out, or in… Only the same sentry, I started to wonder if the guy ever sleeps.
I managed to get some pictures of clues indicating I might be in the right place, it has huge power generators and high end comms technology with industrial transmitters. And to top it all, it has 3 bunker access right in the middle of the camp, both sides of the cabin where the brave smugglers can trade some goods, and the other a little further away. I climbed up the ramp and could snap some pictures of two entrances before jumping down.

Unfortunately, I couldn’t find a way to open the hatches, and I doubt it would have been a good idea for me. I waited for the sleepless sentry to turn his back on me and made my way to the [[Karthu’al]]. I stayed low for a bit before rising up into the atmosphere and out in orbit of the red moon.

To make my report, I made it back to my favorite spot in the universe, good old [[Levski]].
