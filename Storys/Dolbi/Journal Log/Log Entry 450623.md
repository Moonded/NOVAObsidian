Yet another damned meeting complete. This debacle on [[Lyria]] has given me a headache. First, one of our people gets kidnapped after running off. Then we do a full assault on that compound, losing two good marines. And now another full day of meetings. First of which is to meet with [[BandaderArten]] to get the full debrief from him. After that, the usual boring admiral duties and meetings. I want to get this debrief sent up the chain as soon as possible though so this meeting better not take too long.  

During [[Bandaders]] Debrief  

“Sir, after we evacuated the children and our downed members, I left [[ArchangelCorps]] and his team to fully secure the site. When they arrived back, they informed me that they had found intel suggesting that there are other sites located throughout Stanton. It also contained a list of people who had been marked off, except one. I am having [[NOVA Intelligence]] look into this person and the other intel gathered on site.” [[BandaderArten]] stated.  

“This was good work Bandader even though we lost two good marines it could have been worse.”  

“Thank you sir. What are your orders now that we have stopped [[The Orphanage]]?”  

“I want you to form a Task Force with the members that helped you this time. Your mission is to work with [[NOVA Intelligence]] and find the truth behind the intel you found. Also send someone to collect this Malachite person. I want him interrogated and I want to know everything he knows and I want to know by yesterday.”  

“Understood Sir.”  

[[Bandader]] left the room.  

Well that was an interesting story he had to tell, but I’ll give him props, he handled the situation very well under the circumstances. He got all the kids back and rescued our man; not to mention the intel gold mine they found. That will keep [[NOVA Intelligence]] busy for a time and hopefully keep the [[Fleet Admirals]] off my back for a period. I ordered [[BandaderArten]] to create a Task Force as well. I want him and his team to sift through the intel with intelligence and roust this enemy for good. They seemed to work well together so far, so hopefully they can continue that. Now let's send this up and move on with this shit day. May have to break out the good scotch in the office today.
