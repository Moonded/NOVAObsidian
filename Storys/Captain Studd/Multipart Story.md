Captain’s Log 12/07/2953. Time is 11:46 

We are responding to a large distress signal On calliope, it seems this has been sent from a Frigate class ship or above. Best case scenario we get the survivors out, and get the scrap goldmine of our careers. We sure could use a jackpot like this, we’ve not found a single piece of scrap in 2 months and the crew are getting antsy. We are preparing a ground operation to scout the wreckage, the Perseverance is too big for Calliopes hostile atmosphere.

I was hoping for this to be my retirement voyage, Chloe has really stepped into her own, she’s a capable leader and I know the ship will be in good hands under her command. Yet I’ve not had the nerve to break it to the crew, we’ve been through so much together, we’re family. And how do you abandon your family? But we need morale to stay as high as possible for this Op. 
After this operation is through, I can share the news when spirits are hi-

Chloe approaches from behind Steven, startling him

Chloe: “What are you doing there Captain? Playing with your toys again?” She gives him a playful grin

Steven: “It just so happens my toys are very important, and I’m legally required to record our progress on them each and every day” He says sarcastically, to which they both share a laugh
Did Ezekiel give you an update on when the ground operation will be ready?

Chloe: “He’s hesitant, Calliope isn’t the friendliest Moon in the galaxy Captain”

Steven’s attitude visibly sours, and his temper grows short

Steven: “Hesitant?! it’s his god-damn job. The Perseverance is too big too enter calliope’s atmosphere, there’s no way we’d get back out due to the extreme weather conditions, Ezekiel knows this. I am not throwing away this opportunity Because he is too afraid to do his job, We cannot afford to lose this. Tell him and his men to get suited, booted and ready for a hot drop within the hour. Is that clear?”

Chloe is taken back, this attitude from Steven is out of character 

Chloe: “But Captain, we have to put our people Fir-”

Steven: “IS THAT CLEAR. Lieutenant?”

Chloe: “Yes Sir.” She answers Wryly
They both share a wrathful look, then Chloe departs

Steven continues his log
“We must show strength to survive, I know I’m making the right choice. The Ground Operation will go ahead as planned” - End Log



Time – 13:00.

Ezekiel: “We’re all board the Terrapin sir and ready to drop, give us the word”

Steven: “Rosa, Andrew, get on the guns. We need to be ready in case this is a trap”

Rosa & Andrew: “Yes sir.”

Steven: “Zachary is your drone on board the Terrapin?” 

Zachary: “All aboard sir and systems are optimal”

Steven: “Good, Jonathan, Monitor their systems and vitals from the engineering deck”

Jonathan: “Ship systems are in good order and vitals are online, We’re good to go”

Overwhelming pressure engulfs Steven, he has a small panic attack off of comms

Ezekiel: “Sir? Give us the order”

Taking deep breaths he regains his composure

Steven: “You are clear to Launch Sergeant”

Ezekiel: “Affirmative, green to go. Launching in 3…

Chloe walks into the captains quarters

Chloe: “I hope you remember this Captain…

Ezekiel: 2…

Chloe: That if they die today…

Ezekiel: 1…

Chloe: Then it’s all on your shoulders”

Ezekiel: “We have launch, see you on the other side”
