LOG ENTRY: #00198
DATE: *~~*REDACTED*~~*?? ??? 2952  (between malachite-capture and "IRL-now")
N-ID: *~~*REDACTED*~~* - [[CITIZEN]]
CALLSIGN: [[CaptainRoeleveld]]
LOCATION: [[STANTON]]; [[MicroTech]]
SHIP: *~~*REDACTED*~~*

Good thing I parked my Rover inside a cave some distance away. That Mercury would have easily spotted it otherwise.
Whoever is piloting it is good. The package was less than a metre from the specified location.

Now, I just need to wait for whoever is going to come looking for the parts. It's a good thing [[Italina]] detected the small leak in the parts and now that the parts have been dropped, I can definitely detect the signal.

*beep* *beep* Unidentified object approaching target location *beep* *beep*

I put on my helmet, slap the button to open the rear hatch and wait for it to open while grabbing my railgun and my arrowhead rifle. As I walk out, I close the hatch and make my way to the drop point. I arrived just in time to see a Vanguard Sentinel approach.

While the ship is slowly hovering over the drop point, I calmly aim the railgun at the port engine and pull the trigger. The sudden imbalance forces the ship to land. While waiting for the occupant to climb out of the wreckage, I shift my aim to the rear hatch.

First person to run out is wearing heavy armour and is carrying a pair of assault rifles. Guess armour isn't really designed to deal with a railgun shot to the chest.
I notice the turret powering up and turning towards me. I drop the heavy railgun and roll down the slope making sure I'm out of sight of that turret. I quickly crawl/run to my secondary spot and aim the arrowhead at the turret. Good thing I'm wearing white armour, I blend in nicely in the snow.

As I see the 2nd occupant leaving the turret, I shift my aim to the rear hatch and wait. I don't have to wait long and see my target trying to make a run for it. As it's difficult to run without legs, I put a bullet through them. I quickly check to see if he is carrying any weapons. As he clearly isn't and that under suit won't keep him alive for long, I simply walk down and carry him into the rover after tying him up.

Now, let's see how much I remember about my interrogation skills....

= 6 hours later =

Guess I still haven't lost my skills, but I found out more then I was hoping for.

After putting my helmet back, opening the rear hatch, I start moving the bodies, wreckage and the container closer together. I then proceed to place explosives all over the area and retrieve my old railgun. When I'm confident there are no more loose ends, I climb back into the Rover and slowly make my way back to the ~~*REDACTED*~~. Detonating the explosives when I'm far enough away.

As I make my way to where I'll be meeting [[Italina]], I start to consider the usual options, but somehow I feel it's time to make a different choice.
