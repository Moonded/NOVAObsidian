** sigh ** 

I do sometimes wonder if it wouldn't have been better to accept their offer to have my memory of Tyrol wiped. But I don't want to forget about Angel, that would mean they have won.

The nightmares have been a bit more frequent after meeting [[Italina]]'s friend and seeing that guy getting caught. I need to find out how that ended and who the kidnappers were.  

We've always suspected the syndicate was bigger then just Tyrol, we just never thought [[Stanton]] would be infected as well, but observing that battle from afar and the markings on that Carrack looked too familiar.  

Wait... isn't that? Can't be, he's supposed to be dead... I better follow him and see where he is headed.

That's his M50... But how, I know we blew it up, but the markings and ID is the same.  

I will follow him to see where he's going. But first, need to send a quick message to [[Italina]] so she knows what I saw, good thing she installed the stealth comms systems into this ship as well.  

...
...  

Good thing [[Italina]] installed bigger fuel tanks into this ship, I doubt anyone realizes the true range of her now. He made it difficult, but now I know where he is hiding out.

The place looks well defended though, not going to be able to get in on my own. Best head back and think this through. If I hand this data over as well, it will be out of my control. And this... it must stay under my control.
