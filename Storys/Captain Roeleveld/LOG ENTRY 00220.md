[Message received, starting decryption]

"....Hurston.....crate.....family"

Wait, what? Hurston? Family? Crate?

I quickly make my way back to my ship, not caring about the rover, I leave it outside as I run into the ship, slapping the hatch controls on my way past towards the bridge. As I boost out of the atmosphere, I notice the rover being blasted away by the engines.

While waiting for the rest of the message to be decrypted, I redirect all power towards the engines and push them well past their safeties.

As I approach Hurston, I start scanning for Syndicate ships and engage the stealth systems to avoid detection myself. I spot a pair of Scorpius flying around a remote building with a Corsair parked next to it. As I'm about to switch the ship to combat mode, I notice some heavily armed soldiers exiting the building carrying a woman and child. Guess I'm too late, but they're still alive.

I slow down my ship and launch a tracker drone to attach itself to that Corsair, just on time before it takes off with the scorps following.

I park my ship near the building and keep an eye on the tracker.

I don't have to wait too long for another ship to arrive. As I see ArchangelCorps walking out, the Pisces takes off. Not long after, I see a small buggy departing the house. Following the buggy, I notice it disappearing into a hidden hangar. After finding a bigger entrance, I softly land my ship and switch off the stealth systems.

Guess it's time to agree on a plan.
