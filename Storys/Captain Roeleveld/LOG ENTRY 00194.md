N-ID: *~~REDACTED~~* - [[CITIZEN]]
CALLSIGN: [[CaptainRoeleveld]]
LOCATION: [[STANTON]]; [[Orison]]
SHIP: [[Black Knight]]

  

Invictus, it's a nice display of combat ships and of course the [[UEE]] wants to parade some of their biggest ships around.

But as always, it's already in mostly civilized systems. They still leave the majority of the human systems to fend for themselves.  

As I dropped out of quantum, my sensors picked up [[Italina]]'s ship doing a flyby past the Bengals bridge, I wonder what she'd be able to do to improve that ship. I somehow doubt the stealth systems would make much sense for a ship that's visible beyond sensor range.

I will always prefer smaller ships, easier to hide from sensors and prying eyes.  

I sent a brief message to [[Italina]] and boosted down to the cloud city. Of course I don't wait for her response, against her, I need every advantage I can get, even if it can be classed as cheating. If anyone ever wonders, trying to win a fair race against the person maintaining your ship is only possible of the engineer is mediocre. Against a top class engineer, not a chance. And that, again, was proven correct as [[Italina]] speeded past me in reverse with the main engines running on full, only coming to a stop a few centimeters from the wall inside the hangar.  

After storing my ship, I meet her at the little shop and give her a spacewhale fluffy as her prize, which she, as always, accepts with her beautiful smile.  

She mentions she is meeting a contact and I go ahead to check in our bags into the hotel.  

I have a quick shower and as I sit down checking my equipment and the [[Invictus]] schedule [[Italina]] enters the room with a serious look on her face. This is going to be bad news.

"Have a look at these", she says as she hands me a tablet containing pictures. As I go through them, I notice most of them have a mark on them but don't recogni... wait... I go back to the beginning and start noticing that several of those faces belong to our past.

I look up at [[Italina]] and she just nods and indicates I need to keep checking them.  

I slowly go past each of them, near the end of the list, the pictures aren't marked. As I start to wonder about the meaning of the marks, my heart skips a beat when I notice I'm looking at a picture of myself. As the blood drains from my face, I look up and see the same sad look that I saw all those years ago.  

"I got those from my contact, I already checked them and they're authentic. Origin is the old system. I'm sorry, they must have had a backup that we missed."  

"Then I was correct, it was him?"  

She just nods at this as she reaches for the tablet. I hand it to her while taking the pistol and putting it under my jacket. "Well, this is not going to change our plans, I still want to go see the convention center today."  

I take [[Italina]]'s hand and together we make our way to the shuttle.  

=====  

My life could have been so much different. I could still be busy with my parents business, taking it over eventually and living the life I was born into. But it didn't and now here I am, wearing the same suit I've worn dozens of times in the recent past. At first glance, the suit is quite common, but this one isn't. The modifications make it unique, there isn't a suit like it.  

I go through the systems check and make sure the weapons are fully integrated while waiting for the necessary assistance, we checked his history and know he has the necessary skill we need to get into and out of the laboratory. But he prefers to avoid close quarter combat. That's ok as I'll be dealing with that.

The contact will be done in the room next door, depending on how that goes, I'll have a partner or a corpse to deal with. I do prefer the first option as this mission is important. We really need to get her out of there.  

My life, yes... I used to live in Corel and my parents had a small but succesful business until it all went wrong and I had to leave. I organised for most of the ships and equipment to be moved and hidden while I would try and build a new life and identity. What I do now is definitely a new life, but my identity is best kept secret.  

I've often heard bounty hunters claim that after the first few kills, you'll stop caring about the lives you take and simply see it as a job. I'm afraid they were right, again, I lost count of the amount of pirates, drug dealers and other criminals I killed.  

But all that changed when I met this girl, why is it always a girl? She was sitting in a corner of my favourite bar. I grabbed my drink from the bartender and sat down at her table. She just looked up at me, tried a smile and simply said "Yes, I'd like the same as you are having"  

Just those few words and that smile was enough to start changing my life, till then, if I were to answer honestly if I was happy with my life, I would have said yes. But now, thinking back, I would have to admit that it wasn't really a life. It was just living and staying alive.  

The weeks that followed were nice, I was still taking care of criminals during the day, but instead of going to different bars every evening, I spent those with her. After a while she opened up more and I found out about her past. And that is why I'm here now, fully armed and waiting for a partner or another corpse. I really prefer a partner for what is coming though.
