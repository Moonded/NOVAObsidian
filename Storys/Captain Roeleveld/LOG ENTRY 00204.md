[Patient is awake, just left]

Ok, guess it's time to have that conversation. Sitting at my usual table, waiting for the patient to arrive.
Just as I see him walk in, I notice he is attracting a bit more attention than expected.

Wait... is that? And now my old colleague spotted me, best stick to the old ways for now. Explanations will have to wait.

After our little chat, I stay at the table, watching the others to see what happens next. There are a few following him out. And I'm certain my old friend heard most of the conversation. Oh well, nothing new was mentioned there.

I stay at my table for a while longer, waiting...

....ping.... Oh, a new message..

[Deck E, Hangar 33, Mustang]

Ok, 2nd chance.... Hope this goes better

As I enter the hangar, I quickly spot him working on trying to fix that old ship and make sure he notices me approaching. No need to surprise him at this point.

“You ran off before I could properly talk to you…”, I start, but get interrupted “Yeah. You had nothing to offer me… So I left to help myself.”

If the location had been safe, this would have gone different. Oh well, at least I can still offer some help. I toss him a coin, explaining what to do with it. As he, again, asks me what I want in return for stuff, I just say that it’s for another time. Guess he doesn’t know he already agreed to owe me 2 favours. One of these days, I really need to come up with something.

He does seem to relax a little, maybe he will accept that I’m not his enemy after all.

[BEEP]

I quickly check my mobiglass, notice it’s a message about some overt Syndicate activity and make my way out of the hangar. Would have preferred a bit more time, but this is more important than helping him.
