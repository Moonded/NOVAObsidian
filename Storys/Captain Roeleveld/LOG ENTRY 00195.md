Had a good day looking at the ships with Italina, but that picture does still bother me.  

As we were on the shuttle going back to the residential areas for a nice evening meal, my mind wandered back to....  

====
YEAR:2950  

After [[Italina]] sent me a message that the guy in the next room and his ship came up clean from the scans, I had a partner for the rescue. That definitely was my favourite outcome. I put the safety back on the railgun and strapped it onto my back pressing the door button with my free hand.  

The mission was pretty standard for me, get to the base, make my way to the target and then get out again. The only difference, this time the target was not allowed to be hurt, which meant I had to spend time unlocking the last door manually, instead of simply removing the mechanism.  

On the way out, one of the [[Syndicate]]’s ships tried to disable us and get us stranded in the radiation belt. I'm still not sure how my partner managed it, but we were able to limp back to Haven. Before I made my way out of there, I organized for some trusted contacts to make sure he got to the local hospital safely.  

I won't go into too many details about that one though, it's not really my story to tell. This story is more about what happened after we got her out of Haven as even now, after all this time, I will never disclose her location.  

My one-time partner had already left Haven and headed wherever he wanted to go and Italina was waiting for me next to the brand new [[Aegis Vanguard Sentinel]] we had named [[Angel’s Revenge]] which we took to the [[Syndicate’s primary]] base on [[Tyrol VII]]. Remote, far from what goes for civilization and the jump gates. It was here where they modified their ships. And it was here where we would be able to cripple their organization for years to come.

We took the [[Angel's Revenge]] out of the hangar. Myself in the pilot seat and a couple of blades, designed by [[Italina]], hooked up to the turret and transmitters and made our first quantum jump. To avoid being detected easily, we broke the jump aiming for the approach to come from the star, with the radiation coming from there and the stealth tech, they would never see us coming until it was too late.  

When we came out of quantum near [[Tyrol VII]], we flew down towards the surface on the other side of the base, making our way there skimming the surface. When we got into range, sent the signal she had prepared for this, triggering the little subroutine she wrote over 5 years previously. And silently, without anyone in the base noticing, all the external doors started to open, releasing all the atmosphere.  

I powered up the [[Angel’s Revenge]]’s weapons and slowly made my way to the single massive hangar bay. I've heard people say the one at [[GrimHex]] is big, that is only because no one ever saw this one. It's big enough to fit 2 Javelins. But currently, there are only a few ships present. I consider this a shame as I start firing the heavy size five cannon fitted to the front of my ship, ripping holes into the hangar’s resident ships.  

I noticed some movement in the control booth and got the turret to ‘remove’ the windows to get a better look. Yes, I was correct, there were some people standing inside wearing suits, however, unfortunately for them, they were looking out of the windows when they were removed from their housings by the [[Angel’s Revenge]]’s massive cannon.  

Once the hangar was tidied up and all the ships stored within were thoroughly disabled, I landed the ship, put my trusty railgun on my back along with a spare [[FS9]] and took a [[F71]] in my hands as I opened the ramp. With the amount of explosives here, the [[FS9]] might be a bad idea. I think I’d still rather have it than not, however.

I cleared out the base in my usual way, making sure there would be no one left as I terminated the inhabitants with extreme prejudice. I then triggered the bases self-destruct from its control room. I boarded the [[Angel’s Revenge]] and powered up the engines, departing the massive hangar. As I reached what my HUD calculated to be the minimum safe distance, I felt a thud in my seat as the base’s self destruction sent a shockwave which had just passed over me.  

====  

But, with recent events, I start to wonder. Did we really cripple the [[Syndicate]], or did we just anger them? Seeing my face in those pictures, I'm not so sure anymore.  

After the meal, [[Italina]] and I enjoy a nice wine and discuss our past and wonder if we could have done things differently. As is always the case, we wonder if Tyrol was the only location where they kept the stolen stealth-tech or if copies had been made and moved elsewhere....
