[[Italina]] knows I don't like alleys, but guess he insisted on doing it there. But, most important thing, I handed over the bag. Lets hope they can help.  

Still wonder why he thought I wanted something in return, that really surprised me. I told him we'll discuss that some other time. Wasn't sure what else to say and didn't want to stay there too much longer.  

Something tells me I will meet him again, hope it will be in a more friendly location though.
