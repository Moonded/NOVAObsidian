N-ID: <REDACTED> - CITIZEN
CALLSIGN: CaptainRoeleveld
LOCATION: Hurston
SHIP: <REDACTED>

“We are clear, I’ll be on site in two minutes. Be prepared to leave quickly.” I send to ArchAngel as I make my way to him and his family.
Just before landing, I switch off the stealth systems and push the powerplant to full capacity to quickly charge the shields.

I see ArchAngel pick up his daughter and together with his wife they jump onto the ramp and make their way into the ship quickly. As they clear the ramp, I close it and watch them make their way to the lift. As they make their way up, I slowly start moving away and open the door to the medbay and suggest we put his daughter on the medbed first. As she's on the bed and the parents are seated on the chairs, I redirect full power to the engines and accelerate hard, jumping into quantum as soon as we get clear.
After a few more jumps, I engage the stealth layer and direct the ship below the planetary plane, before making my way to the medbay.

On my way there, I quickly check the results of the scan and notice a subdermal implant. I instruct the medbed to remove it and store it for later analysis and to release the safety restraints.
As I enter the medbay, I nod to ArchAngel as he picks up his daughter again.

"May I suggest we also check your wife is ok", I suggest as I help her onto the medbed. Luckily, this time no implant is detected and after sharing some refreshment, I invite ArchAngel to the bridge so we can make our way back to the NSS Emelia.
