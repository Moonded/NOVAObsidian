CALLSIGN: CaptainRoeleveld
LOCATION: <REDACTED>
SHIP: <REDACTED>

As I get alerted to an approaching Carrack, I sit down and have a small breakfast. Waiting for what that ship is planning.
Seeing the Pisces take off and head down, I load up the remaining weapons onto my suit and make my way to the facility.

As I enter the facility, my suit alerts me to some movement. I direct a drone to that direction and notice someone sneaking around in white Orc-mkx armour. Keeping him under surveillance, I make my way into a building, pull out my gun and wait.
To make sure he comes to me, I shift a little to make a noise. As he climbs up the stairs, pull the trigger. Damn, missed. Ducking to avoid his shots, I shoot a few more times. Cursing under my breath.

Hearing other ships approach, I'm about to jump out of the building to make it to a better position as I hear him shout "Sounds like you friends are on their way here. Want to make this easy for me and give up?”

As I'm alone, I simply respond with: “My friends have style, guess they must be yours!”

I guess that made him think as the next thing I see is him holding up his gun asking for a cease-fire, just as I recognize Syndicate markings on the three Cutties coming into sight. "Shit!"
Being asked to provide cover while he plans to meet them to get his friend back, I agree.
Knowing full well how that will end, I make my way to where I stashed the nearest railgun, I slowly aim it at the leader and initiate the charging sequence. Waiting for a signal.

As soon as I hear him yell “You just fucked up. Now!”, I squeeze the trigger and take out 5 guys in a single shot. Always nice when they line up like that.
Seeing he is taking care of the soldiers, I target the lead cutlass and fire a second shot. Being unable to target the others, I make my way down the building to get a better angle. I notice him targeting his rifle in my direction, but as he pulls the trigger before aiming at me, I notice a guy trying to take me out getting an extra eye socket.

I nod a thanks and make my way to a better position to target the next cutty. With the shields up, it takes me 2 shots to take that one down. At which point the third makes a run for it as more ships approach.

I then make my way towards him and agree to meet him on his ship after collecting my gear.
