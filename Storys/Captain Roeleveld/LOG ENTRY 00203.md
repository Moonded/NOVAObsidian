Wait, "VIRUS DETECTED"?!?!?

I quickly instructed the flight computer to disengage from the flight systems and to run a full antivirus scan on the primary and secondary systems before making my way to the medical room.
There, I quickly start to remove the Armor suit and dress him in one of my backups to keep him alive as long as possible.
Just to be safe, I also removed the battery from his suit, before connecting the memory circuits to an analyser to extract a copy.
While waiting for the memory to be duplicated, I hear the quantum drive slowing down. Approaching the jump gate, as this is not something I can trust the autopilot to manage, I make my way to the pilot seat and take over the controls. Guess analysing that suit will have to wait.

As I drop out of quantum, I hear the "ping" notification that the queued messages are sent and a double-ping indicating new incoming messages have been received. I'll leave those for later and cut past a Hull C on my way through the gate.

On the other side, I notice several combat ships waiting. Can't tell if they're there to assist in getting the Hull to its destination or if they plan to offload the cargo elsewhere. Any other time, I'd have stayed. But not this time. I align my ship and start the first leg in quantum. Even with the stealth layer, I'm not going to approach in a direct path. After a few trips in different directions, I align for a longer leg, engage the drive and lean back to check my messages.

Ah, only 1... [No Target Yet. New Contact. Possible Source]
I wonder who, will find out eventually. Too bad I don't have a target yet.

During my final approach, I noticed some strange readings coming from the stealth layer as I switch it off. Best not advertise this tech around here.

After landing and ensuring my Cousins are still in control of this area, I have my patient moved to the hospital and pay for his treatment.
