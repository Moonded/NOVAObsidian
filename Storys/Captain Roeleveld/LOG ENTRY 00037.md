------------------------------------BEGIN LOG-------------------------------------- 

I really need to keep a better log, but never been too good at writing down my own
thoughts. Guess the old lady was right about me.  

Anyway, I'm back in the halo, watching the rocks float past is nice and relaxing.
Much better then trying to avoid the rubbish at [[ArcTech]]. I wish everywhere was as
clean as [[MicroTech]], but that place is simply too far away.  

I do need to find a better area in the Halo, this one has been emptied already, not
many good rocks around here and the scanner is broken again. Now, where did I put
that toolkit?  

...GARBLED...  

Ok, the scanner is fixed, better have Italina look into that when I get back to
port though. Hope she won't be too angry about my repairs this time. My ears are
still hurting from last time. Need to find some diamonds for her, maybe that
will help?
