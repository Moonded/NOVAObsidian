[Signature detected]

One day, I should program the computer to actually mention which signature it detects. Over the years, I must have added several to the list.

As I make my way to the console, I wonder if it detected a call from [[Italina]].

As I stare in disbelief at the display, I wonder what the [[Syndicate]] is up to this time. This time, the signal is easier to detect than the previous time which makes me even more suspicious. But, I'll better investigate this as well, but not without a few safety measures.

On my way to the [[Star Runner]]â€™s flight deck, I instruct the computer to lock all doors and disable all the door controls. After that, I arm the trip mines in the cargo area. On the flight deck I put fresh magazines into the rifles stored there and make a final check to make sure they're all reliable before hopping into the seat and making my way to that signal.

...

I drop out of quantum before I get too close, disable the flight control systems and engage full stealth mode, slowly making my way to where that signal is coming from.

[Multiple signatures detected]

[WARNING: Hostile ships detected]

"Aaargh, it's a trap", I sigh as I move my hand to the stealth control and have a good look at the sensor display. My hand stops an inch above the control as I see a [[400i]] being attacked by multiple [[Syndicate]] ships. As I sit back and watch the assault happen, hating not being able to help the victim, I start to recognize the flight-pattern of that 400i looks familiar, but without active scanning, I can't be certain.
