SHIP: [[Black Knight]]

  

Visited [[Italina]] again, she had some more changes to do to my ship. Now have a better scanner and my ship will be less easy to see. I'm still hoping she'll figure out how to do cloaking like in those old entertainment shows I used to watch when I grew up, but the latest addition is already nice.  

She got a reply from her contact about getting the data they found, but nothing specific came back yet, we're guessing he needs to check with whoever is in charge of that group.

We hope they will take her warning seriously about *~~REDACTED~~*. We dealt with him before and barely survived.  

[[Italina]]'s sister is safe, even though we don't know where she currently is. Last time I saw her, she was not happy to have been taken away from the Syndicate. But Italina did receive a message a year ago from her where she thanked her for getting her out.  

Seeing him again showed that memories are never truly forgotten, I will never forget what I saw in that laboratory. Rows and rows of beds with people attached to machines with wires and hoses. It was supposed to be humanitarian aid, but there were not many humans there anymore.  

I have started to hear their screams again from when they realized they couldn't get away from the fires. But with luck, those will fade again eventually. Maybe it is getting time to finish it once and for all.
