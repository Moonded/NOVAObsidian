N-ID: <REDACTED> - CITIZEN
CALLSIGN: CaptainRoeleveld
LOCATION: <REDACTED>
SHIP: <REDACTED>

While the auto pilot is guiding my ship back to the jump point to Stanton at maximum speed, I'm going over the datafile.

Apparently, the Syndicate captured an admiral from NOVA and they are trying to get him back. Do those fools really think they'll get him back alive?

Lets see, what else is there:
Location: Euterpe - Delvin Scrap & Salvage.

Perfect, plenty of places to hide my gear.

Date: 23 Sep 2952
Plenty of time.

I send a quick message ahead to confirm receipt and acceptance and make my way to the kitchen to prepare some pancakes. I do hope to find some more eggs at some point.

I clean the kitchen after dinner and decide to have a nap.

[BEEP BEEP - Approaching Jump Point - BEEP BEEP]

I get up, fully awake as the computer informs me we're nearly at the jump point. I have a quick coffee and sit down in the pilot seat.
Disabling the auto pilot, I take over control and boost my way to the front of the queue and through the gate.

As I enter Stanton, I switch on the stealth layer and turn away from the planets and head out into the void.
After docking, I shut down all ships systems and make my way to the armoury and load a trolley with weapons, ammo and sensors before pushing it onto the C2. As it already has a Pisces inside, I got the auto pilot to go on the long way round to MicroTech.
Slowly stacking up my gear into the Pisces, I hear the Quantum drive kick in and I sit down in the pilot seat, waiting for the ship to get near MT.

As I hear the quantum drive spool down, I close the ramp of the Pisces and power up the ship. I see the front door open and slowly take the Pisces out and slowly make my way down to Euterpe as I get the scanner drones to move ahead to check the target is still clear.

After getting confirmation, I land and hide the ship and make my way through the facility. Hiding weapons all over the place. With my preparations done, I make my way back to the Pisces and settle down for the night.
