So it’s a lovely afternoon and what a great day to take our Cadets out on a battle stations training exercise around [[MicroTech]]! What makes this even more exciting is the fact that we have a top-secret Ship AI system installed onboard an Origin 890 Jump. One of NOVA’s commanders [[Nalzock]] designed and created the first prototype to its physical state to which I have been asked to run the initial test phase

This AI far exceeds any manual systems or the “human” component for the ship, it is able to pilot the ship through both quantum and visual space, as well as within atmosphere of planets and moons. It is capable of running individual system component checks within an Attosecond and a full system diagnostic scan within a centi second pending on the size of the ship. The AI pre-assignment was able to run a FULL 890 system diagnostic check within 6 Deci seconds…. Remarkable feature and technology. Now its time to take a physicalized AI version onboard the 890 and put it through its paces all the meanwhile taking 8 new cadets on basic battle stations training for this series. I’ve asked the cadets to report for duty at New Babbage space port at 18H00 and we start the training from there. 

If all tests for AI pass our rigorous standards for simulation we can pass the results onto [[NOVA HQ]] for consideration installing the AI onboard the Archangel – our high commands 890 as well as all the other 890 series in our [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] fleet..

Report will follow after phase 1 testing complete
