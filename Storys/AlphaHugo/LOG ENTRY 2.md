As I go through the morning notions of getting ready for work, I still struggle to shake the chills from the dream. Don’t know if I should rather call that a nightmare? As I sip away at my extra bean coffee, my mobiglass pings with a notification… NEW Application for First Contact. Applicant: [[ChaoticVasti]]. Skills and Experience: Science and Biology. Biogenetics. Botany and Zoologist PH degrees. 
WAIT a minute… Slept with the Boss? I chuckle as immediately my thoughts are refreshed with with a memory of [[ChaoticVasti]]…. Choatic absolutely. She threw my life upside down, but in a great way. What an adventure that fling was.. Ok, this should be interesting, and that our paths now cross once again must be a sign of yet another adventure looming…. I click accept and reply with a meeting schedule date, why not at a bar? Couldn’t hurt right lol.

Meeting (though felt more like a date) went well, and we rehashed the old days, more laughter than anything. I’m proud of what she made of her life and the path she chose will most certainly fit well into my teams framework. We need a strong candidate such as her. Lets hope I can actually focus on the tasks at hand and not get too derailed or defocused with her around me, she is looking super attractive… think I’m creating a new word for our galactic dictionary… WOWAGEOUS
Stoked to have her as part of First Contact, and the scientific breakthroughs we will be able to achieve for [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] with her on our side
