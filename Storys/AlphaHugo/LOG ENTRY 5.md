Its been a tough couple of months and our task force assigned with finding a downed pilot [[Aldrich Aimes]] as well as the high value doses of vaccine en transit has been nothing short of a nuisance considering the 9Tails and Cosigans Cult responsible for this mess. 

We originally sent out a search and rescue team to the last known distress estimated location, and when that turned out dry the ships signal was traced to [[Daymar]]. We headed there and during the low altitude search encountered heavy ground resistance near TPF west of Tandom Plains Aid Shelter. One of our squads were able slip by the combat on the left flank and on the continued search located the Cutlass Red, undamaged and abandoned near the bunker. Sadly though no signs of Aldrich Aimes or the medicine...

After running the ships navigation logs as well as the communication logs we managed to identify the handoff meeting location where the medicine was to be passed onto Cosigans Cult from the 9Tails.

We grouped a ground assault squad under the Delta Force Insignia and proceeded to intercept the meeting to recover the medicine and try ascertain what happened to poor Aldrich. Again, even more resitance was encountered and although we lost several of our team, we managed to take a CC member hostage for interrogation before being forced to retreat due to unexpected losses and heavy well prepared enemy forces...

The interrogation went well and we uncovered at least where Aldrich Aimes was being held captive. Immediately before we the trail went cold we reassembled and went to a cave hideout on Daymar. What lay ahead was anything but an easy operation.

The 9Tails and Cosigans Cult were well entrenched and again infiltration into the cave initially was simple, their forces forces overpowered the lower cave area and left us in a dire situation of not reaching Aldrich as more 9Tails were enroute and we couldnt afford facing a battle of 2 fronts. During the retreat we did manage to extract another CC member for interrogation.

This led us to our current scenario, we have arranged to do a prisoner exchange, their CC member for Aldrich Aimes and whats left of the missing medicine vaccines. We're regrouping and ensuring we amass a large team led by [[Captain_Gunter]] to complete the exchange.
