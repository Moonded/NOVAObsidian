1. DATE: [REDACTED @RP 1 of 2 ] N-ID: <NB-SR388-9848> - CITIZEN CALLSIGN: ShaRroos LOCATION: STANTON; MicroTech; New Babbage; ShaRroos Solution Systems Garage STANTON: Crusader; Orison; Multiple SHIP: “Verdant Visions” NSS-10100 600i Explorer Origin "Natalie" NSS-13782 Avenger Titan Aegis The sharp trill of a ratcheting steel bearing sings in the tight walkway. A warm amber glow lights up the tiny bunk. Orange cargo pants kneel on the bed as a redheaded woman flexes her arms twisting on a bolt letting the panel fall with a clatter onto the floor. “Hum. Yea, I can clean this up. Yea that size one plant should fit in here just fine!” She backs away with a smile, tossing her wrench onto the bed. The tan dropcloth muffles the thud as it leaves a dent in the fabric. Her hands plunge into one of many pouches slung around her waist retrieving a pair of glasses. The purple lenses flair to life as they rest on the bridge of her nose. “Okay, I can route that redundancy on the starboard side. This cabling will be useful for accessing primary thruster assembly…” Half gloved hands play with the Augmented Reality image, making notes of plans of where to cut and what can be shoved out of the way. Her head tilts as she traces the inner workings that no manufacturer really wants its user’s to find. ‘TINK’ rings through the small habitation section. The snug hallway letting the sound bounce around. Snapping the lenses off her face, ShaRroos looks around and finds a bolt sitting on top of the abandoned plate. Tilting her head one of her hands opens up a pouch on her chest dumping out the hunks of steel into her palm. Quickly she counts the bolts and narrows her eyes on the unknown bolt. “Now where did ‘you’ come from?” The metal in hand is shoved back into the pouch as she leans down, plucking the stranger from the plate. The purple lenses are mounted back over her green eyes just a dull thud sounds off her skull. (edited)

    Quickly the clatter of another bolt bouncing off the floor fills the hallway. Her head glances up then quickly tracks the free bolt. “What the…” her words cut short as the sounds of poorly contained giggles roll from the door leading to the small cargo grid. A smirk rolls up her lips with a sigh “Love you too Hayden.” The giggles break into absolute laughter as another woman walks into view. Her caramel skin almost glowing, backlit by the bright cargo lighting. Her black hair shines a deep blue in the light as her sky gray eyes glimmer with joy. “Well if my wife wants to keep me waiting then I get to have some fun at her expense?” She steps into the door twisting slightly at her hips to slide her shoulders though the narrow opening, her smile twisting into a smirk. “You forgot didn’t you?” Hayden’s voice dripped with accusation. ShaRroos quickly drops the bolt in her hand flipping her wrist over checking the time. “We were supposed to leave at … oh that was 2 hours ago.” The redheads words trail off as she realizes the mistake. Her hands fall to her sides as she looks up at the smiling woman. With a WAY to chipper voice her black haired wife retorts. “And THAT is why I keep Carter on payroll. She already has Quentin en route here to come pick us up. You lost your chance to fly on our vacation.” She tosses another bolt at ShaRroos playfully. “So secure your tools ‘Verdant Visions’ will be here soon.” She spins on her heels, letting her purple dress flutter in her twirl before skipping off the aff cargo ramp. ShaRroos catches the tossed bolt standing from the floor shaking her head. “That woman might know me too well.” The loose bolts are stuffed into a pouch as she snatches her wrench from the bed and begins to clean up the workspace. As she works she speaks to no one in particular. “Don’t worry ‘Natalie’ I will have your new heart installed and up and running on time and, knowing Hayden UNDER budget.”

    She flicks off lights and closes the cargo ramp on the Titan just as the large hangar doors overhead split, letting in the bite of New Babbage air. The large shimmering green hull of his wife’s 600i descends onto the shop floor. “Time to go rub elbows I suppose” ‘PING!’-‘PING!’-‘PING!’ thunders through the room. The sound causing the large canopy to shake, gently sending shivers along the pink and cream clouds beyond the transparent wall. A thick male voice cracks over the speaker “Madam Hayden, your attention is required on the bridge. We have an urgent communication from Orison Actual!” The two women’s eyes snap open at the claxton, furiously blinking their eyes to shake the sleep from the corners. In a flury both women grab the edges of their covers tossing them to the center where the thick duvet collapses on itself. A sharp triple chirp from ShaRroos’ bracelet snags her attention as she begins to find her feet. A purple nightgown runs out of the door. With a quick look at the caller ShaRroos finds a familiar large N. “LT ShaRroos speaking. How can I help?” she sounds off. An urgent voice cuts in with stress straining the edges of his words. “NOVA has a top priority mission requiring YOUR immediate deployment. Form up with Admiral Angera. You will be assigned to his unit for this engagement.” ShaRroos’ green eyes dart across her screen Looking for the name. “Hu … ye… yes understood. Engaging with Admiral Angera.” She closes the link before quickly tapping on the new name. Before she could get word one out a deep male voice thick with experience, and shallow on pleasantries barks over the link. “LT ShaRroos get your ass down to the Crusader showroom roof. Bring as MUCH combat gear as you can haul and as quickly as you can.

    NOVA uniform is appreciated but not required. Just as long as it is not purple. I already talked to your wife, she has her job now, hurry up and get yours done.” The line cuts before the redhead could .. anything. “SUB this is not a good way to wake up!” she shouts, jumping onto the bed running over it. Pajamas are tossed across the room as she hops one leg into the first undersuit yanked from the drawers. Tugging in one arm she slams open the armor locker finding her light pilot armor. “NOPE! Guns and this don’t mix!” Leaving the door to hang open she bounds out of her room, half falling into her suit. The spiral O emblazoned on the wall flashes by as she dashes though the second door flying across the cargo deck, and sprinting into the back hallway. Turning the corner she runs by several crew before skidding to a stop. “BLANCH! .. You have your maintenance suit on board right!” The addressed woman recoils at the request before nodding emphatically. “Good, I am going to have to borrow it, like now. I will replace it, I promise!” Not waiting for a response the redhead darts through the spacious quarters to the hallway beyond. A finger traces each locker until ‘Seal, Balance’ is found and tossed open. The mountain of yellow construction armor is quickly snatched from it’s perch. Heavy clacks of hardened steel boots sound off the ceramic backed durafoam streets as the yellow armored woman half runs up the stairs. The 3 hard shelled yellow backpacks held in her arms clatter loudly as she hop, skips though the closing elevator. A yellow helmet, well worn with honest earned gouges and marks from it’s considerable history, squares its center mounted light and collection of sensors at the elevator controls.

    Heaving deep breaths one box is set on the floor with a solid THUD before punching the controls for the roof. Once again the backpack is hefted up, a single strap half lashed against her shoulder. As soon as the doors split the yellow blur bounds back out of the elevator. Her face quickly pans about the roof finding a collection of armored personnel gathering on one side. The unmistakable red armor worn only by the ‘Crimson Guard’ quickly catches her attention. Half jogging the clattering mess of metal, flesh and very full backpacks clamer over. The metallic tinged voice of a rough speaker keys up “Admiral Angera, LT ShaRroos reporting as requested.” Quickly the three carried backpacks along with the one bolted to her harness hit the roof with a sounded ‘thud’ “I have C54, S71, P4, and P6, a couple dozen mags for each, already loaded.” The yellow boxes are thrown open sharing their secrets for everyone assembled. Assemble they did, the small loose collection begins to tighten up as the yellow one speaks through her cheap mic. “A case and a half of Cruze, a few med guns, maybe a dozen gell vials, and as many pens as I could grab.”
    
6. _[_7:05 AM_]_
    
    The tallest of the group leans in, looking over the offered supplies, with a nod of his head several of those gathered around kneel and begin handing out the equipment plugging the holes in their respective loadouts. The tallest waves ShaRroos away from the group as they scramble to stock up. The red blazed helmet looks her up and down. His wizen voice cracks over the local speakers. “LT ShaRroos, that was a fine response time. As well, a nice collection of gear to show up with. Hayden has already found a flight path for us to get over to The residential platform.” His head snaps up as a craft approaches the roof. “Looks like the Civilian Defense Force came through with our ride.” With a practiced swift motion a very large rifle, with a proportionally large magazine is yanked from his shoulder, turning to the collection of armor storing the last of the gear. His local speaker turned up to shout those on the roof. **“UNIT FORM UP!”** Quickly the menagerie of armor lines up as the Admiral walks the line. “HERE is your brief. High command ‘FleshFear’ was looking to buy us some new toys. Some Purple Pirate Punks decided they did not like that idea and have locked down a large chunk of this city. We are going in there to show them **HOW BIG OF A MISTAKE THAT WAS!**” His attention drifts to the holo screen on his wrist, with a couple of punches the line of armor begins tapping the sides of their helmets. ShaRroos’ yellow glove following suit accepting the unit invite. Blue triangles light up her hud marking everyone on the unit as the IFF updates. “With that said they are HIGHLY armed. Keep your head down unless you are taking theirs off. We will **NOT BE PRIVY** to any airsupport, less this shuttle.” (edited)

    His red gauntlet waves to the white and blue gondola sliding up to the side of the roof. “This is because those Purple Pirate Punks have turned the city's defenses against itself. Thanks to ‘Launchpad’ we can get a small unit in. That’s us.” He turns away from the unit and begins to walk with determination to the shuttle. **”Do you need ANOTHER invitation!”** he shouts back without turning. The line looks at each other for just a second before quickly dashing after Admiral Angera. “Reloading!” ShaRroos calls over the coms as she kneels behind the pile of crates. The quality of her _cover_ called in question as a bullet screams past her shoulder. Her yellow knee resting on the purple and blue alloy armor of someone that got in the unit’s way. With a deep breath her spent mag is tossed to the ground and a new one ripped off her chest. The sharp snap of metal setting into metal barely audible over the rapid fire around her. She glances at the elevator behind her briefly before planting her foot and bringing the barrel of her rifle over the top of her position. “ShaRroos up! Engaging right! 2 heavy cover low wall 2o’clock, 20 meters!” Her rifle rings out a triple crack. The flash spoiled her sight for an instant. “One down.” The single light on her helmet quickly pans the urban clutter. The insta barriers, stacked haphazardly next to large orange shipping containers with white text, long obscured by bullet holes and black soot of explosions, dot the streets. Her radio crackles to life. “2 o’clock down, new contact 11, down.”
    
8. _[_7:05 AM_]_
    
    A cool voice dripping with authority cuts in with a small picture of a black and red helmet taking it’s place on the top right of the HUD. Green eyes dart up to check the sender before snapping off another triple shot, this time to her left. “ShaRroos - Angera” ShaRroos’ helmet flicks to the left, using the yellow shoulder armor to key up. Choosing her words carefully she cooly calls back. “Angera - ShaRroos. Light resistance elevator still secure” The stern voice returns the woman's call. “ShaRroos you are now ‘Escort’. Primary will be on the ground floor in 20. Your body is between the Purple and him.” Another spray of metal launches from her rifle before she calls back. “ShaRroos Ack Escort. Pending delivery.” As soon as she closes her link the elevator opens. A single well dressed man strolls out of the elevator. His face seething with contempt as he brushes some debris from his nearly pristine black vest. ShaRroos’ yellow gloved left hand waves him down and points to the corner next to her before tapping the side of her helmet. “Boss Fleshfear, I am ShaRroos. Please duck here while we wait for Vanguard. Take this and stuff it anywhere, pocket shoe whatever.” She produces a pen-like device and hands it backwards to the approaching suit. A swift sweep from his well polished loafers clear a spot of rubble from the ground before he takes a knee behind the yellow armored woman. A forlorn sigh rolls from his lips as he shakes his head taking the pen “I was 10 minutes from closing that order. Then **THESE** buffoons had to show up!” He shakes his head one more time then rests a hand on the back armor plate of the woman in front of him. The offered pen stuffed in the breast pocket of the perfectly tailored white shirt, then covered once again with his vest. “ShaRroos was it? My regen is in your hands.”
    
9. _[_7:06 AM_]_
    
    The hand resting on ShaRroos’ back thumps twice on her shoulder before his arm, adorned with a pressed white sleeve, props itself up on his bent knee.  
    “Floor: Angera Elevator on main floor in 10 sitrep” The commanding presence of too many battles rips through the unit’s com channel. A friendly voice, tained by strained breath, calls back “Floor: 2 possible contact in AO, deep cover at 2 and 11. Last call med green. Ammo basic yellow. Ammo special red” Once again Angera’s voice claims the coms. “All, less Escort, form on Angera. V spread wide. Specials take wings. Escort find my ass stick 20 paces behind it, secondary to last order” Before the elevators finish sliding open the large barrel of his larger SMG pushes through. The red powered armor stares down the iron sights pushing through the door. 4 others pour out of the elevator behind him, fanning out as they exit the fatal funnel. The 3 others posted up behind boxes and debris stand, and fall into formation. A rapid pouring of hot metal belches from the tip of the V. A moment later sharper cracks from the left. Angera calls out “2 o'clock down. Pushing to ride. Right clear that container” Another voice pipes up “11 o’clock down” The yellow armor stands and motions for the slightly scuffed loafers to follow as her rifle pulls up to her shoulder.
    
10. _[_7:06 AM_]_
    
    Screams of pain flood the channel “Right 3 Hit, down contact to my right!” The speed of transmissions key up quickly. “Right 4 eyes on, 4 o’clock 3 contacts.” “Right 2 in cover tractor incoming for 3.” Angera’s voice cuts though once more. “Cover fall back, building to 10 o’clock. Suppressive fire to 4 o’clock.” Another voice chimes in “Right 4 hit still mobile” The left yellow armored arm of ShaRroos snaps out pushing the VERY annoyed, way over dressed man behind her as her gun snaps off several quick fits of metal into the building that was to her right. She shouts out though her local speaker. “Boss Stay close, I am going to be backing up into you.” The light on her helmet snaps to the right as she checks over her shoulder. Her helmet hud lights up with a red crescent the moment before she yells out over her speaker. “Gahh! Escort hit mobile.” her eyes check the bottom left of her hud as her helmet snaps around checking to see if her High Command is still intact. Thankfully he was following directions and was just a couple of paces behind her. “Primary green!” The angry red circle estimating the yellow armor’s occupant combat effectiveness at 70% and falling. Looking for options her green eyes spot an insta barrier just outside the called bunker point. Her breath becomes labored as she starts to wheeze into the still open local speaker. Frantically she elbows the man behind her, tossing her head at the spotted barrier. “There _cough_ take cover now” Without waiting to be told a second time, once again his loafer scoots clean a spot as he kneels down behind the barrier.

    ShaRroos kneels next to her primary duty. His tailored and unflappable composure foils against the scars and dents of the well worn yellow armor. She tosses her rifle to the ground, snatching a red vial from her left hip. The clatter of metal and composites dance ontop of the spray of energy blasts and high velocity rounds ringing out to touch those in the distance. The chorus is returned with the high twang of slug against reinforced ballistic steel and the bone rattling thud of plasma splashing against concrete.
