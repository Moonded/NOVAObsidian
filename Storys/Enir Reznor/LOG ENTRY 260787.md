---------- Begin Log ---------  

After the mission, I finally had time to recuperate and see my fianc√©. She was worried sick as usual but knew my skills as a medic. I'm still fatigued trying to save the 2 [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] squamates but unfortunately they didn't make it their injuries were tank related and was beyond my medical help. On the other hand the mission was a huge success and we brought back the kiddos and the Rookie as well as some interesting intel. We had some amazing snipers watching our backs. They were like our personal guardian angels haha.  

After the Debrief we all had the same look on our faces. When and where are we going next. only our CO's knew that answers. The rest of us will have to find out soon because what ever traumatized those kids. They are going to have to answer for what they did.
