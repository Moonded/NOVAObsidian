Hey Moms, hey Pops, I know it has been a few months since I wrote but you wouldn't believe it! After the Operation a few months back, I was nominated to become a [[Commander]]. I start my training as soon as I get up in the morning. I can't believe it! They said that I had proven myself as an effective medic and that my own commander nominated me. Maybe it's those medical classes that I taught that helped me in my nomination as well.  

-Tears roll down my face as I'm clicking away on the board-  

[[Dowg]] has been an amazing commander to me and I hope one day I can be as good as him, heck maybe even better than him. He has trained me hard along with some other commanders to prove that I am capable enough to be a full on commander and start my OWN squad. Maybe then I will try to get stationed in [[Reisse]] and continue my investigation.  

I know.. I know … y'all are probably rolling your eyes at me telling me that i should leave the past in the past. But you KNOW this doesn't sit right with me… I let out a big sigh

I bet it's one of those thugs in Pryo that has something to do with it. They were sketchy when we faced them and still don't sit right with me how they treated those kids.. I know I'm not supposed to give out details but let us just say that the kids weren't the only things we found in that building.  

-Alarm goes off-  

-takes a deep breathe and shuts off the alarm-  

I'll have to end this short. I just want to let you know that I have not forgotten. She will pay as well once I ask her some questions face to face.
