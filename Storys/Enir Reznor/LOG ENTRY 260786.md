Had a interesting date tonight.. Even in the noisy bar I could over hear some interesting characters. I am sure I saw Max there but from my view it could've have been anyone. Maddy sure got drunk though. She said she saw a guy running off yelling about Hangar 4. Probably just a bunch of drunks making a bet. But its good to be back home.

-----BUZZ-----

--what's this?..

-----CONFIDENTAL----INCOMING MESSAGE---- CONFIDENTAL----

Its from my CO.. … … Well, guess my R&R is over.. Cant say much on here but he said he needs a "qualified medical personal" and I have been chosen for a special mission..
Gods I hope Maddy doesn't get mad like I'm sure she will.
