---------- Begin Log ---------

Its raining out side for the second night in the row and I only wish it would never stop. As the rain pellet's the window and the wind howls, I couldn't help to have a flashback to my childhood on [[Reisse]]. it was towards the end of the day and my Father and Mother were down stairs watching a movie, probably a comedy show seeing how there is none on that planet, and my older brother sound asleep in the room next to mine. I stayed upstairs and it was just me, the rain, and my books to study. Through my window, I could faintly see the lights of [[BiotiCorp]] in the distance shining through the heavy rain. Being around Candalor is a busy site as well. Sometimes you get to see the medical shipments land in the distance just behind the rocks. I love the country side.  

As thunder roars it naps me back into my present life. I look over to see my Maddy still sound asleep. I brush some hair away from her face. she gently wakes up, looks at me and says

[[Maddy]]: "Honey why are you still awake?"

Me: "I will sleep here soon, go back to sleep, I love you"

[[Maddy]]: "OKAY what ever you say mister..."  

She rolls over and leaves me back to ponder. I still cant help but think also about the 2 [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] members, the kids and how bad it got so fast not knowing about that damn tank. But it was nice to see Max in that squad as well. I'm happy he made it out safe with us. Also we formed a new squadron called Task [[Force Azrael]]. Its a pretty badass name that the guys came up with. As the rain continues I should probably get some sleep
