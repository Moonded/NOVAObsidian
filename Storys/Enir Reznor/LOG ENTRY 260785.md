(Sigh) Hey Moms, hey Pops, I hope your doing well where ever the hell you are. Its been awhile since I had the courage to even write you. Even though it has been 7 years since your accident, it still hurts to even think about that damn mission you both decided to go on. I get that it is our job as medical professionals to help out [[UEE]] but I still blame that pilot that was transporting you. (deep breath) If [[BiotiCorp]] hadn't been a big part of my life, I would have left sooner but I was still too young and still in the [[University]].  

But enough about the past. Maddy is doing great and we recently got engaged while I was on shore leave. (Laugh) I know, I know, It's about damn time. We've only been together since my Novice years in the [[UEE Academy]].

We live in a nice little condo here on [[ArcCorp]]. She keeps me in line and makes sure I come home safely. You would think that after 6 years in the [[UEE]] she would have been a little easier on me. (Laugh)  

we recently came in contact with a [[Organization]] here on [[ArcCorp]] called "[[Nova Intergalactic]]". I needed work and that ring isn't going to pay off itself (Chuckle). Maddy wants no part of this Org saying that it is no different than being

back in the [[UEE Navy]] but I feel like this place is going to change our lives. I was inducted into a really awesome squad with some really interesting guys. "[[Leviathans]]" they call themselves (chuckle). They crew some pretty big ships and explore the edges of the universe.  

[(knock knock knock).. Honey? What should I wear tonight for dinner?]  

(laugh) I love you both, and I'll write again soon. I promise.
