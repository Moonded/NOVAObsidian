Star Date: 10-11-2952
N-ID: 5091196490639 - [[Commander]]    
Callsign: [[DemonikWolfe]]
System: [[ArcCorp]]
Location: [[NSS Horizon Explorer]]

After reading the report from the [[NOVA Relief Branch]] and the incident report from [[BlacJac Security]], I called [[Engineer Specialist]] [[JinnSox]], previously [[JimSox]] into the commanders office onboard the [[NSS Horizon Explorer]] orbiting above [[ArcCorp]]:

*door blips three times

[[DemonikWolfe]]: "Come in."

*Door swishes open and [[JinnSox]] enters, approaches desk, comes to attention.

[[JinnSox]]: "Specialist [[JinnSox]] reporting as ordered."

[[DemonikWolfe]]: "Thank you for coming in Specialist, have a seat. Would you like some water or something else?"

*The commander stands and walks over to the cabinet to take out 2 water bottles, brings one back and sits it on the desk in front of [[JinnSox]] before sitting back at his desk.

[[JinnSox]]: "Thank you sir."

[[DemonikWolfe]]: "I was just going over the reports from the attack on the cloning area, how are you doing? Have your memory engrams fully solidified?", he paused then added, "Do you think you are ready to come back to work?"

[[JinnSox]]: "Absolutely sir! Never felt better!", JinnSox sits straight and stiff, eyes focused straight ahead.

[[DemonikWolfe]]: "I am glad to hear it. The medical evaluation says there is a 2% chance of error on the results of the scans, but they clear you for duty. [[ARIES]] needs you and your technical expertise. I just want to make sure you are good to go and are completely sure there have been no issues. According to the reports, some genetic material was removed during your cloning process and a large amount of [[Hemozal]] added right after cloning may have had some adverse affects to the process."

[[JinnSox]]: *stared straight ahead for a long time "I am fine sir. There is nothing I want more than to get back to work with the team! I just need some new uniforms, that's all."

[[DemonikWolfe]]: *furrows his brow and nods a few times then taps his desk display, swipes to the squad record and updates personal data record changing from [[JimSox]] to [[JinnSox]], then changes the status from Medical Leave to Active Duty. "Done and Done. I expect you to let me know if you have any adverse side affects, but I am confident in your abilities. Welcome back to work, now get back to it. Dismissed."
