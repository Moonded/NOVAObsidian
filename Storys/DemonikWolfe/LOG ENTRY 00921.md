Time: 2030 A18 Local.  

Today I took a job from a local foreman that runs a team on [[ARC L1]] in the refinery. He was waiting on a shipment of Titanium and it was a week overdue. He was desperate because his supply was running low since no one seems to want to mine and sell anything but Quantanuim lately. I wasn't really interested, but he doubled, then tripled his offer. I was suspicious and a bit wary of taking it each time he increased his offer, but in the end I took it. After all, I owed him for getting me a date with the girl up in [[Admin]] last month. She was definitely worth a bit of danger.

The caterpillar had been reported last seen near Wala, inbound for [[ARC L1]], then it's transponder went dark. I headed over to Wala and setup a reciprocal course between Wala and the origin point of the Caterpillar. I let my NAV Computer do some estimates and it gave me several possible paths to search. I hit pay dirt on the 8th course.

I spotted the wreck of the caterpillar and flew in closer. I did not see evidence that there were survivors or pirates around the ship, so I sent a message to report the location of the crashed ship to the authorities. I scanned the wreck site and picked up a container with dense energy readings which I assumed could be the titanium since it matched the amount I was looking for. I made one more pass and sat my ship down on a flat area near the crash site.

It took me a bit of stumbling to get up to the wreckage on the side of the hill, but the lower gravity helped. Someone had been here. There were many flares lit around the area. I drew my side arm and cautiously investigated. I found one civilian, dead, possibly a crew member. Then inside I found another body, most likely a pirate. Nearby, I spotted a laser trip mine. I was able to back off and find another way into the wreckage. It took me another 20 minutes to slowly make my way into the ship and find the cargo box. I could tell that the ship had been looted and was surprised this container was left behind. I checked for traps and then inspected the contents. Everything checked out, so I used my MultiTool Tractor Beam to move the container outside thru a missing wall panel.

Satisfied that I had found the Titanium, I decided to see what else might have been left behind.

Not much, as it turned out. However, I found a blueprint in the captains quarters. Not rolled up or on a shelf. No, this one was displayed on the wall in a fancy acrylic encased frame. It turned out to be an original blueprint for a railgun invented by [[ARCFLASH]] LABS back in 2020, over 930 years ago! It was called the GR-1 "ANVIL" and looked extremely primitive and heavy compared to more powerful present-day versions. I took a few minutes to carefully remove it.

I didn't tell my friend about the blueprint when I returned his lost cargo to him. The blueprint now hangs in my small hab area. I thought about taking it to a collector and making some aUECs, but the cool factor is too good to ignore. Hey, maybe that girl from Admin will think I have some class when she sees it. Nah.

Blueprint found on wreckage.
