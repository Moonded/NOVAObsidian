Few weeks have passed. Docs at Redacted did a solid job on my knee.  

However, I have had time to upgrade some Armor. Got my target sensors upgraded in my helmet, a few new sets of flight suits with upgrades, as well as some more color variations of gear I enjoy. Its good to have a mix depending on the weather. New toys lol.  

I overheard from some guys at the bar that [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] apparently assaulted a facility on [[Hurston]]. Not too sure what it is, word on the block is that it was just some pirates being taken care of, however I'm not too sure. In the deeper parts of the area, Iv heard the word "[[Orphanage]]" thrown about, and I also overheard those [[NOVA commanders]] mention the word.  

I'm thinking there is more to this, yet I think I am going to leave it sit until something else...happens.  

I'll be heading out again soon. Hopefully I haven't lost any of my talents.
