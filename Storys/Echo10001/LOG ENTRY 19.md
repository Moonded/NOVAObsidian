Just got off my last job. Clean as usual, and my client was happy.  

Decided to relax for a few days, clean up, get new weapons and Armor.  

Something interesting happened today. I was in a bar, rather empty, having some drinks. I began to notice a group gathering.

I didn't recognize any of them, but I noticed one at the table was in a [[NOVA commander uniform]]. I kept to myself, but made stayed aware of them.

They seemed to be talking, and a new guy in full gear, face hidden, walked in. He was armed.  

He sat down, and they began talking. Now secret meetings aren't uncommon, but having an armed unknown visit a [[NOVA commander]] and his men...well that's a different story.  

I reached up, and hit my ear piece. I listen in, maybe there will be something that will be worthwhile.

"[[Orphanage Operation]]... Garbled... picking children...Static quite elusive"  

Damnit...my earpiece is still damaged from that shockwave...ill fix it later.  

"Spoke to [[Malachite]]...static...[[Freelancer Orphanage]]..."  

One guy raises his [[MobiGlass]], and suddenly there is a mood shift at the table.  

"Hangar 4...leaving soon...Hurry."  

One of the group runs out the bar.  

Hmm...I'll keep an eye out on this...something seemed amiss.
