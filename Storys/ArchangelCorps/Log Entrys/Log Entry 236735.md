Well that could have gone a whole lot worse. I don't know what tipped them off so easily to my position but them bastards had snipers set up all over the place. I took a few of them out but not before one of their rounds hit me in the left leg. Lucky for me I had a partner up there who tended to me so I didn't lose a lot of blood. Not a bad kid though, bloody good sniper as well, kinda proud to call him one of my squad mates.  

We ended up losing two members of the security force that assaulted [[the Orphanage]]. I never did get their names but their sacrifice saved those kids and got us a shit ton of intel. One thing for certain, I am going to get approval to haul [[Malachite]] in. The dung heap of a “friend” sold us out. Got one of our men captured and those boys killed. He will pay for crossing me.  

Well I am off to this Debrief. They are wanting us to do individual debriefs prior to the release of the full operational debrief.  

1 Hour Later  

OFFICIAL ORPHANAGE ASSAULT OPERATION DEBRIEF, INTENDED FOR [[DOLBI]], [[NOVA ADMIRAL]]. CLASSIFIED  

After the rookie had run off to sneak aboard the freelancer I was ordered to follow them and give on the ground intel for the [[NOVA Security]] force that was being pulled together. I landed a few kilometres outside the AO and hiked in. I didn't need the hostiles knowing that I was coming.  

I had gotten to my position prior to the freelancer landing. Which was either a blessing or a curse seeing as I was able to see them unloading the rookie off the freelancer. He had been captured and was now a hostage with the children. I had reported that and the number of forces estimating about a half a dozen to a dozen. They had also had a [[Carrack]] and the [[Freelancer]] on site. I assumed the Carrack was their main vehicle they would leave with.

After I had given my report I waited. About an hour later I was given word that another [[Catulan Reaver]] member would be joining me on the mountain. The Security force would be coming in on cyclones from the East and West of the facility. Prior to them arriving though I noticed a Nova Tank coming from the mountain opposite of me. It was smoking a little, almost like it wasn't fully operational. I contacted Command and gave them a warning. It was a bit too late though as I saw the first [[Cyclone]] come around the mountain. They dodged a few shots but one landed close to them. Must have done some damage because it stopped moving. And that's when I heard Cepheus report that they were now on foot, no injuries.  

What I didn't realize though was the hostiles had put snipers on the mountain side as well. One of them boys took a shot at me. Wasn't a great sniper but his shot did hit me in the thigh. Lucky for me, [[Perdroblunttoker]] was on site with me and was able to heal me up quick enough. Which was good seeing as I had the enemy sniper in my sights and eliminated before I was fully healed. About that same time [[Cepheus]] came over the radio requesting Sniper fire on an entrenched hostile due south of him hidden in a rock outcropping. Neither [[Pedro]] or myself could see him so we hauled ass to a new location and were able to get a clear line of sight on the two targets. I was able to eliminate one of the targets but the other fell back to the carrack and out of sight.

A few moments later we saw an explosion, one of the cyclones had been hit by the [[Nova Tank]], but we heard over the comms that they survived. I found it odd though because after that the Nova Tank drove off and around the mountain. Over comms we could hear the battle going on around the building and carrack. I believe [[Pedro]] was able to take out one of the targets around the building assisting the team on the ground, but we did lose two members on the assault team.  

[[BandaderArten]] had come over comms shortly after requesting Evac for the children and the rookie. Pedro hauled ass back to the Pisces that he had brought and made his way to the pick up location. When the Security team exited the building they took fire from the west, where the tank had driven off too. Apparently the two operators had left the tank and came back on foot. One making it down to the freelancer and the other hidden up the hill sniping. [[Bandader]] and his team were able to eliminate the one by them and I was able to move locations and eliminate the sniper.  

Once the civilians had been evacuated I had made my way down to [[The Orphanage]]. Some of the guys were taken back for injuries, but I stayed with the last few to search for intel. We pulled all the logs from [[The Orphanage]], the [[Freelancer]], and the [[Carrack]]. I wanted to make sure we grabbed everything so that [[NOVA Intelligence]] could pull as much data as possible about what this site was for. After that I made my way back to my ship and then headed back to [[Area 18]] to hit the hospital. 

END OF DEBRIEF  

Well now that that is all over I am going to head over to the bar for a drink. After that, I need to call home and let the family know that I am ok and we rescued the kids. I’ll be interested to see what [[NOVA Intelligence]] pulls off of those logs and what we are going to do with that information.
