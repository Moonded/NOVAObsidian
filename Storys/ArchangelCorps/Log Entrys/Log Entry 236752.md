I was standing inside the observation room of the interrogation suite waiting for [[Cepheus]] to show up. After our debrief with [[Dolbi]] and [[Bandader]] we were given the green light to interrogate Malachite. Since we captured him I had been itching to get some answers.  

A few minutes later [[Cepheus]] walked in. “You ready to do this?” He asked.  

I chuckled a bit, “I’ve been ready for some time now. Let’s get this over with.”  

We entered the interrogation room. Malachite was sitting there with a dark hood over his head. As we walked closer, I dropped his file down on the table making a loud noise, which made him jump a bit. Good he’s jumpy. I sat down in front of him, while [[Cepheus]] walked around him and pulled the hood off before leaning against the edge of the table.  

[[Cepheus]] spoke first, “Welcome back to [[Area 18]], [[Malachite]]. Last time we were here you gave us some false information that led us into a trap. Have anything to say about that?”  

Malachite gave a coy smirk, “I have no idea what you are talking about. I gave you the only information I knew.”  

In a rapid motion I kicked out of the chair, grabbed the back of his head and slammed it into the table. “Wrong answer bud!”  

[[Cepheus]] gave me what I knew was a disapproving look through that damn helmet before speaking again. “We don’t have to get violent just yet… Do we?.” he said, placing a hand on Malachite’s shoulder. I walked back over to the wall and just leaned up against it and gave Malachite a look that said that the first chance I got I would make his life a living hell.  

[[Cepheus]] spoke again, “Like [[ArchangelCorps]] said, that’s the wrong answer. We have all the evidence from the orphanage that shows you were the leader of that operation. What we want to know now is who do you work for?”  

[[Malachite]] leaned back in his chair blinking the dizziness away. “If you have all that information you should already know.”  

“We know that you work for a larger organization, we want to know what their name is and where we might find them.”  

Malachite smirked again, “How about you give me a steak and some credits and maybe I’ll consider giving you information that will have me worse than killed.” Obviously trying to toy with us.  

I piped up on that note, “Only credit you’re going to get is a name engraved on your tombstone back on whatever goddamn planet you are from. You better tell me who you work for or that table and your face are about to get much further acquainted.” .” I could tell Cepheus had to hold back a laugh on that one.  

Steadying himself, Cepheus piped in, “Look, you’ve been caught. We own your ass now. We are going to get what we need out of you, then, and only then, might you spend the rest of your days in a [[UEE prison]] cell, alive.”  

Malachite glared back at me. “I was only caught because my guards couldn't kill you and your pitiful band. While a good idea, I guess the EMP didn’t work as well as it could have.”  

“You’re joking with me now. That pitiful band eliminated over two dozen of your men and captured you. Now just answer the damn question. Where can we find your boss?” I said with a grin on my face.  

“You won't find him here. He is out of your reach [[ArchangelCorps]]. Even with your resource you can’t reach him in Py…” He caught himself before fishing the sentence.

“Ah, so your leader is in Pyro. Thanks for that. And I may not have been able to reach him a few years ago, but with the resources we have now, we will be there soon enough.”  

[[Cepheus]] chimmened in, “How many other facilities do you have in Stanton? And know that our Intelligence group is already putting together a list from the intel we have grabbed from your guys, both at the orphanage and at your hideout.”  

“You won't get much off those pawns. Most of them worked directly for me, not for the Syndicate. But I might be able to give you some leads for some better accommodations.” Malachite scoffed.  

[[Cepheus]] tilted his head slightly, “‘Syndicate’, huh? I haven’t heard that name yet. Although I might just be behind the curve as I’m sure our Intel guys have known that for weeks…” [[Cepheus]] paused briefly, then continued. “We can see about the accommodations but we need that information first.”  

I hated to think that he may get something better than rotting in a jail cell but I’ll play this game.  

Malachite agreed and gave some leads of locations that the Syndicate had been using.  

I finally spoke up, “What were you doing with those kids?”  

Malachite looked at me and grinned, “The same thing they did to you but we weed out the moralities that made you leave.”  

I wasn’t surprised. I had always figured they were making them into cold heartless soldiers. Just glad we caught him saying it because [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] and the [[UEE]] don't take too kindly to child soldiers.  

I looked at [[Cepheus]], “I have all I need, we can leave him to the Intelligence guys now.” I looked back at [[Malachite]], “I’ll be seeing you around Malachite. Next time you may not be so lucky to be captured.”  

After I had exited the room, [[Cepheus]] just behind me nearly at the door’s threshold, Malachite spit out, “Hey, tin man, why the full faced helmet all the time? Even as broken as that thing on your head is and you refuse to take it off… Ain’t hiding anything from ol’ [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]], are you?” “Piss off.” [[Cepheus]] spit back, not stopping his stride out the door.  

With that I walked out of the room. [[Cepheus]] and I stopped in the hall and he said, “Well that went well enough. Slamming his face into the table probably wasn’t necessary quite so early.”  

“Eh, that was just a warm up. I had many other things planned for him. Some things probably best left unsaid, I doubt [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] would be ok with those. But it was effective, we got the information we needed.”  

“Agreed. We will talk with [[BandaderArten]] and [[Dolbi]] and see what their thoughts are. Hopefully we can finish weeding out their spots here in Stanton before we make the move to [[Pyro]]. But we can discuss that another time. I need to go deal with some Squadron stuff now and fix my armor.”  

“No worries bud, we will get with the higher ups here in the next couple days and get to cleaning [[Stanton]] up.”  

With that we parted ways. I made my way back to the hangers where I had recalled my Picses. Figured I would head back to the Emelia that was docked at Bajini Point. I had told the Ghosts we would be shipping out to Hurston for some R&R once we had the interrogation done. Frankly this R&R was more for me than the guys. Wanted to get back to my family and spend a few days at home. Also wouldn't mind taking a couple guys on a small hunting trip around the savannah.
