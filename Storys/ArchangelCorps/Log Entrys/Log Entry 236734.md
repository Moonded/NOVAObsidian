System: [[Stanton]]
Location: [[Lyria]], outskirts of [[The Orphanage]]

  

The rookie decided to run off and board the freelancer. Kids going to get himself killed. The Wing Commander sent me to follow the ship and get eyes on the Orphanage. So, I hopped in the [[NSS Dauntless]], a [[Drake Cutlass Black]] that I have used on numerous missions prior to [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]]. I had my Dragonfly loaded as well. I’m going to land a ways out and go the rest of the way on it. Hopefully I can get there in time to see what’s going on and get some solid intel for [[BandaderArten]] and the [[NOVA Security]] force that he is putting together.  

A few moments later.  

Well, I have landed and made my way to one of the ridges overlooking the orphanage. I can’t believe it, but I made it in time to watch the Freelancer land. I grabbed my binoculars and called up Command on my MobiGlass.  

“Command from [[ArchangelCorps]], reporting in.”  

“Go for Command.”  

“Command, I have eyes on the orphanage. The [[Freelancer]] is landing and there as well as a [[Carrack]]. I see about a half a dozen personnel on the exterior and at least a few more moving inside the building. The freelancer is opening up…. SHIT! They have the rookie. I repeat the rookie has been captured and is being moved at gun point into the orphanage with the kids.”

“Archangel did you say they have captured the rookie?”  

“Affirmative, they now have another hostage command.”  

“Understood [[ArchangelCorps]]. Remain on site. [[NOVA Security]] is gathering, and we will be on site shortly. If conditions change report back.”  

“Copy command, will remain on site until further notice. [[ArchangelCorps]] out.”  

Well, this day just got far worse than any of us expected. I have no doubt the Malachite was behind that ambush. When we get our boy back and rescue these kids, I am going to find him, and he will be glad that [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] is keeping my hands tied down a bit because he would not live to see another day. 

All I can do now is sit here and wait for [[NOVA Security]] to get here. Let’s hope they hurry.
