Part 2 of 4

We were about an hour out from my meeting with [[ShaRroos]] when a ping went across my desk. It was the Salvage team's report on the destruction of the Point of No Return. I pulled it up…well shit that’s not good. Near the top of the report was a recent inspection done by none other than [[ShaRroos]]. It showed that she registered the ship as a Salvage vessel, which I know damn well [[Ceph]] wasn’t doing Salvage. Not to mention the long list of modifications done to the 400i, some of which were extremely illegal, but [[ShaRroos]] seemed to have concealed them pretty damn well. I knew [[Ceph]] had added shit to his ship but I didn’t realize how much. This was going to be very hard to explain to Admiralty why one of their Commanders had these mods, but that’s for another day. For now I need to focus on learning about these materials and getting [[ShaRroos]] to trust me.

We made our final approach to [[New Babbage]]. I told my team to remain on the ship and that I would not be long. I made my way to the Technical Deck and retrieved the piece of metal I was studying earlier and then made my way to the Pisces stowed in the Hanger Bay of the Emelia. I opened the hanger doors and made my way to [[ShaRroos]] Solution Systems Garage.

“[[Archangel]] to [[ShaRroos]], I am on approach via Pisces, requesting hangar access”

“Request granted sir, hangar doors opening”

I landed the Pisces inside the Hanger and shut the engines down. I flipped the seat around and walked to the back of the ship. I hit the switch and the door hissed opened. Standing behind a yellow line was this short haired redhead. She was wearing some utilitarian outfit with more pockets than I could count and had a set of glasses on that you could tell were some special tech by the glowing lights around the frames. You could tell the job kept her fit, she was toned enough that made me think she could eat some of my guys alive. 

As I approached she spoke, “Pleasure to meet you sir.”

“The pleasures all mine ma’am”

“If you would follow me we can talk in my office”

“Sounds good,” as I followed her I looked around the shop. “Impressive shop you got here.”

“Thank you, my wife and I work hard to keep it that way.”

We made our way into her office and she offered me a seat and I graciously took it. 

“So you said you have a product that you thought I might know about.”

I reached into my bag and grabbed the piece of metal and sat it on her desk. “Yes, a mutual friend had dropped this off with me a few days ago. I have seen this material before but only in passing. I was wondering if you knew anything about it.”

[[ShaRroos]] picked it up and looked at it. Feeling every inch of the material, seeing how it shined in the light. After a few quiet minutes, [[ShaRroos]] sat it back down on the desk. “Well I don't know much about this. Personally I have only seen this one other time when working on some rich kids 325a. But other than that I don’t know much.”

I could tell she was holding something back, but her mentioning the ship aspect makes me think of that pilot I killed back in the day. I wonder if he was flying some sort of ship made out of this material. “Do you know who owned the ship?”

“Not well, registered as a ‘Mr. Smith,’ so good luck with that. The rich kid just said he recently got it and wanted to tune it for racing.”

“Well thank you for looking at it.”

She began to stand up, obviously thinking we were done. “Before I go though, do you know the ship called The Point of No Return?” She tensed up for a second before sitting back down. Probably didn't think I noticed it but years of studying people and you tend to read them easily. 

“Yes I know the ship. It is a salvage vessel; was in here just the other day for an inspection. Why do you ask?”

“Well we got a distress beacon yesterday and found that she had been destroyed and [[Cepheus]] was missing.”
“Oh dear, do you know what happened?”

“All we can tell at this point was he was attacked by someone and they took him.”

“Do you know who?”

I find it interesting that she is asking questions and acting like nothing was abnormal about the ship. I wonder if she knows that I know she's lying about it being a salvage vessel. “We think it is an enemy that we have been tracking for several months, but you don’t need to worry about them.”

“Well thank you for telling me, she was a good looking vessel, sad to hear that happened.”

At that point I flipped the switch, “Cut the crap, I know you fudge the inspection. And before you clam up, know that I don’t care. I know [[Ceph]] personally and I knew that he had some modifications done to his ship. Frankly when I got the list back, I was impressed with how well the cover was, but I recognized the handy work of someone hiding something, I have done shit similar.” 

“Sir, I don’t know what you're getting at. This shop is above board on how we operate. If you take issue with the paperwork I can have my wife's lawyers give you a call. There is nothing illegal about his ship or the inspection. I think we are done here.” She stood up and began to walk past me; I stood up and placed a gentle hand on her shoulder to stop her, which pissed her off even more. As she reached for a wrench sitting on the counter next to her she said, “Get your hand off me.” 

I looked at her with concern in my eyes, “Look, I don’t care what you did. And to be very clear, I might hire you for a job or two. But I need your help in this matter. One of my best Commanders is missing, his ship is destroyed, probably by the Syndicate, and I am carrying what I believe to be some high end material for ships that is not on the market. I have no doubt that you know something more, or at least know someone who does. And that's all I am asking, just give me a direction to go. Plus, when questioned by my superiors, know that nothing will fall back on you or Ceph if someone notices what I did.”

She stood there for a second glaring at me but as I spoke and she saw my concern, she softened a bit, or at least appeared to as she set the wrench back down. “Fine, I know someone who might be able to help. But I won't give you their name or information. I will contact them and have them contact you. And, I don’t need you protection, like I said everything was and is completely legal here.”

“Fine, just tell your contact that I am a friend, and that if they wish to meet it will be off the record and not through official channels. I have no doubt they will look me up before contacting me, so I have no doubt they will understand the cloak and dagger stuff.” 

I could tell she was processing that. “Fine. I will let them know and if they decide to meet they will contact you. Until then please leave my shop.” 

“Understood. I do appreciate the help. And like I said, I am very impressed with your work, keep up the ‘legal’ stuff.” I left her office and made my way back to the Pisces. As I lifted off I smiled a bit, she reminded me a lot of my wife with that fiery attitude. 

I made my way back to the Emelia and landed back in the hangar. My second in command met me as I walked into the adjacent hall, “Anything good sir?”

“Maybe, have our pilot set a course back to Hurston.”

“What is our next mission?”

“At the moment, we wait.”

“Understood sir.”

He made his way to the cockpit as I walked to my quarters. Once I received word from her contact I was going to have to meet with the Admiral. So I better get my duck in a row.
