==Thirteen years prior==  

Unknown person: “You have been tasked with infiltrating the compound obtaining the prototype and eliminating the target. In the file there is a dossier on a person known as [[Malachite]]. He will assist you in gaining access to the compound and smuggling your equipment in. The funds for his service have been transferred to your account.”  

“Copy that. I am en'route to [[ArcCorp]] to meet with [[Malachite]].”  

And off again I go to take out another “high valued target.” I’m not going to complain about the work seeing as they pay me way more than I could ever imagine. This time though will be like something out of one of those old [[Earth]] films…what was it called…oh that's right 007. I am going to “attend” some big wigs party at his compound. I am paying some low life to smuggle some weapons and gear into the party. Once I am in, I have to sneak into this guy's vault and obtain some prototype weapon. Once I have it they want me to kill the poor bastard sucks cuz this guy has made some cool tech over the years.  

==Present Day==

I’m sitting here at the bar on [[Bajini Point]] looking at this dossier. It feels like it's been ages since I pulled it up. After using Malachite to help me with a few missions back in the day, I never really looked at it. Back then he was just a lowly smuggler. Nothing special about him other than the government letting him continue running his operations since we were using him too.  

I called Wing Commander [[Bandader]] and [[Cepheus]] to the bar. Figured I should come clean about my involvement with him over the years. Looking at some of his old haunts may help us find him, but he’s got dozens of them now, he's been busy over the last thirteen years. But I am sure one of these locations is where he is hiding.  

[[Cepheus]] and [[Bandader]] walk into the bar and sit down at the booth with me.  

“Well guys I figure it's about time you learn a little more about how I know Malachite.”  

[[Bandader]] nodded, “Go on.”  

I explained to them what I used to do a little more in depth. I explained I used to do a number of jobs for my “group”. Pretty much anything from sabotage and assassinations, to infiltrations and procuring items of value. I told them that I met [[Malachite]] about thirteen years prior. He was chosen by my group to assist in smuggling my gear into a fancy party. At said party I was to obtain a certain item and eliminate the host. But I did tell them that the names of the people I dealt with were extremely classified and I would not talk about that.  

[[Bandader]] pondered for a minute, while [[Cepheus]] sat in silence just taking it all in. Finally Bandader said, “Wow, I knew you did some shady stuff while working for them, but I would have never thought it was that shady. With that being said though it seems like you know how Malachite thinks. What are your thoughts, [[Cepheus]]?”  

Cepheus continued to sit there in silence for a few moments before speaking, “Well I want to know how on [[Terra]] someone gets a job assassinating people with a government badge, but it sounds pretty sweet I can't lie. he said with a chuckle. “But I do agree with [[Bandader]], it seems like you might be able to narrow this search down a bit. Got Any ideas?”  

“Well I have a few. First he isn't going back to the city, nor any of the major ports. He knows we will be looking for him. He's going to find some place that is easily defended and well hidden. Maybe an unknown bunker, possibly some ship hidden in the belt, maybe even one of these caves on the list. But which one I have no idea. [[Cepheus]] do you think you could reach out to your contact that gave you the tip about [[Malachites]] involvement and see if they can put some feelers out there?”

[[Bandader]] spoke up, “Good deal, seems like the two of you have this handled then.” He stands up to leave, “Keep me posted on what you find out. The sooner we arrest him the better.” He walks out of the bar leaving just [[Cepheus]] and I there having a drink.  

Cepheus looks at me, knowing I am extremely pissed about how [[Malachite]] screwed us. “Well now that the brass is gone, what aren't you telling me?”  

“You know we haven’t worked together that long and you already assume I’m not telling you everything…frankly I don't want to arrest him. I want to kill him and leave for the crows.”  

“ I wanna smoke the bastard just as bad as you, but you know [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] command will never greenlight that. ”  

“Not yet at least. We have to interrogate him first. I just hope they let me in the room to do that.”  

“If you're in there, I will be too. He's not getting away with what he did. But try and keep your cool, you’re going to be a commander soon and you need to keep a level head in front of your team. I’m not sure if Hal will be any use to me, we aren't exactly friends. He did kind of shoot me the last time I saw him. Nevertheless I’ll see if he’ll answer a call..” [[Cepheus]] got up and walked out of the bar.  

I sat there for a few minutes before paying for my drink and heading to the habitats. Maybe a good night's sleep will help me clear my mind. I am going to call Kira first though, she has always been able to calm me down; almost like she can see into my mind and light up the darkness.
