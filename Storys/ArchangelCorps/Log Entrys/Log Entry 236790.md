N-ID: 643856 - [[Wing Commander]]
Callsign: [[ArchangelCorps]]
System: [[Stanton]], [[Hurston]]
Location: [[NSS Emelia]]

I was only gone a few days and yet I walked back into a shit storm. 

I had landed back at home and got the *Outrider* stored away. Once that was done I contacted the *NSS Emelia* for pick up. During that call though my second in Command told me a heads up that one of our Admirals had been kidnapped during a mining operation. Seems like the Syndicate has stuck again. He also gave me fair warning that the brass was not happy, especially since all this happened after Cepheus’ disappearance and me being off the grid. Sounds like there will be a lot of explaining to do. 

After stopping by the house to see the family the Pisces landed out front to bring me back to the *Emelia*. Once onboard I made my way back to my quarters with the scanner tucked away in my bag. As I stepped out of the hangar bay my second in command stepped up, “Sir, the Admiral contacted us earlier and stated that you need to call him as soon as you were aboard.”

“Good, I need to inform him of some developments as well. Any other news that I should be concerned about.”

“Negative sir. Other than the kidnapping, nothing else has happened. We still have no word from Cepheus either.”

“Understood. Well better get this call out of the way. I’ll let you know the plan after the meeting,” I said as I stepped into my quarters and shut the door. I sat my bag down on my bunk and retrieved the scanner. I went back into the office and sat down, pulling up a comm link to contact the admiral. It rang a couple times before he picked up, “ArchangelCorps, glad to see you have returned in one piece. Sorry that it's not the greatest time though. I assume your Commander has informed you of the kidnapping?”

“Thanks sir and yes he told me about it. He also informed me we still haven't heard anything from Cepheus as well.”

“That’s correct. Although I don;t think the Syndicate has him.”

“Why do you say that?”

“Well for starters we got a message from the Syndicate earlier today. In that message there were a few major things. First, they called you out specifically. Seems like you have some cargo that they would like back in exchange for our Admiral. Which was the second part, they only mentioned the Admiral. There was no mention of any other NOVA member, which makes me think they don't have him. And if they don’t have him that can mean one of two things: one, he is with them and works for them or two, he was taken by someone else. I would prefer to side with the latter, but we won't know for sure until we hear from him.”

“Ah, well I agree, I would prefer the latter as well. As for being called out, I am not surprised. If they knew Ceph had some of this material then they know that I do too. I would also assume the reason they haven't attacked me directly like they did Ceph is the contingent of forces that are here with me. Did they say where they want to make the exchange?”

“I would agree with your assessment as well. As for a location the coordinates they sent line up with *Delvin Scrap & Salvage* on Euterpe, a moon of Microtech. They stated they would contact us with a date and time soon. They also asked for you to come alone.”

“Figures, they want to make sure I don't have any back up close by. What does the rest of the brass think?”

“Well they don’t like that one of our Admirals was kidnapped. Especially while Cepheus is MIA and you were ‘unavailable’, but I kept them calmed down enough to see this as an opportunity. I know it's asking a lot, but do you think you can do it, and not get taken?”
“Honestly sir, I have no clue. With that being said though, I’m not going to say no in trying. I’ll have teams ready to quantum to my location if shit hits the fan. Personally I suggest my team and I head there now so I can scout out the pace. I might be able to get the drop on them. If not, I at least be able to get an idea of what I am walking into.”

“Sounds like you have a plan then. I’ll leave you to make the final preparations. Just make sure to keep us updated every step of the way. This is an extremely high profile exchange.”

“Understood sir. We will bring the Admiral back.”

“Good. Now that that's taken care of, was your covert mission successful.”

“In a way, yes it was. I met with someone and learned quite a lot about the stealth tech. I was also given a scanner that would allow us to locate stealth ships in an AO. The only issue is I was only given one. My question to you is, what ship do you want us to install this in?”

“A scanner you say. That could prove to be extremely beneficial. As for what ship to install it in, I’ll have to discuss that with the other Admirals and the Fleet Admiral. In my opinion though, I think you should install it in the Emelia see as you and her are on the frontlines. It would probably prove to be more beneficial to you than on any of our other ships. But I will have an answer for you before you reach MicroTech. Anything else, maybe a name to this mysterious person?”

“Sorry sir, nothing else. At least for now.”

“Understood, I just hope they are playing us for fools.”

“I seriously doubt that sir. By the way they talked, they have no love for the Syndicate either.”

“So the enemy of my enemy is my friend.”

“Exactly.”

“Well then, if there is nothing else I will leave you to your mission. Good luck ArchangelCorps.” With that the line went dead. I stood up and headed to the cockpit where my pilot and Commander were at. As I walked in both turned to me and the Commander asked, “So where we haeadin sir?”

“We’re heading back to MicroTech. Specifically to Euterpe. Plot a course and start heading that direction.”

The pilot nodded and turned back around, beginning to plot our course. I looked at the Commander, “Make sure the Pisces is squared away and ready to use as well. I’ll be needing to use it when we get there. Also get the squad ready and coordinate with our dropships. I’ll need everyone squared away and ready to deploy if and when I give the order.”

“Understood sir I’ll get it taken care of.” With that he strode out the door to begin preparations. As soon as we began moving, I made my way back to my quarters to begin getting my gear together. Nothing like being thrown back into the thick of it right off the bat. Let’s just hope this plan works, or else it won't end well for me or the Admiral.
