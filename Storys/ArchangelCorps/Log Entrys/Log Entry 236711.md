I feel the wind blowing around me, hearing the rustle of the underbrush and tree limbs. All else is calm and silent, then from beside me I hear, “Dad are we done yet, I am bored.” To might right is my daughter Emmy. Being young she has yet to learn patience.  

“We are almost finished. See the dust moving there? That’s the herd we are looking for.” We had been following a small herd of deer through the savannahs of [[Hurston]]. It was time for her to learn how to track and hunt. I had spent most of her childhood fighting for government in less than peaceful places and these were the moments that would last.  

We continued for another mile laying low and staying below the peak of the hill. I told her it was so we could remain hidden until we were close enough. Finally, we were there and made our way to a small bramble that would conceal our location. The herd was only a few hundred meters away. At this distance I had no doubt Emmy could make her mark. She had become a great shot at the range, enough so that the owner wanted her to compete.  

As we lay there the wind shifts. Something else is there. You could smell the stench of death on the air. “What is that awful smell dad?”  

“I don’t know peanut, but I don’t think we should stay here.” As I say that I see it. Off to the north a ship was hidden behind a small rock outcropping. My heart sank when I recognized smugglers. If my daughter wasn’t with me, I would have rid this system of them. But alas she was here, and I could not put her in danger. I tell her to back out slowly and she understands. We make our way down the hill and round the corner when we walk into part of the group standing next to their Ursa Rover. Without a word they draw their weapons up.  

“RUN!!” Emmy turns around and makes her way out of their sight as BOOM.  

I jerk awake, sweating profusely, taking in my surroundings. It takes me a few seconds to realize that I am in my quarters on the [[NSS Inquisitor]]. It had been a few months since that fateful day. We some how survived and got home with nothing but a few scratches. Shortly after is when Commander [[BandaderArten]] recruited me to be his squadrons Marksman. I appreciated the work. I always felt surer behind a rifle than behind a desk.  

It had been a month since the Commander had told us of the Orphanage and the kids involved. Since then, my nights have been fitful thinking of nothing other than [[Emmy]]. Her and her mom are the only reasons I continue to fight. If the Commander tells us that we are abandoning this current mission to go help take care of this “orphanage,” I will be more than happy to help clean up [[Lyria]].  

For now, I am just going to go workout. Maybe [[Scredox]] is there; he was the last time I stumbled in in the middle of the night.
