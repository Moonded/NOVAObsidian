Well it's been a couple months since my last log and man has it been a crazy ride. When I got the news of Malachite's death I was shocked but after some thought I really wasn't that surprised to find out there was a mole in [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]]. The [[Admiral]] and [[Wing Commander]] have been keeping us busy. We have rooted out two more [[Syndicate]] Cells but still no luck on finding more intel on the main base. All we know is it's in [[Pyro]]. 

But we were called back to [[NOVA HQ]] a few days ago. Apparently there was a meeting and the [[Admiral]] of [[NOVA Marines]] wished to speak with me. Bandader had told me to be sure and be in my Class A uniform. So here I am making my way to [[NOVA HQ|HQ]] in this scratchy attire. I always preferred being in my under suit and Armor. Felt more comfortable and more protective. But enough of that let’s go in and see what all the fuss is about. 

Inside [[NOVA HQ]] [[Admiral]] of [[NOVA Marines Office]]

“Good afternoon sir.”

“Good afternoon [[Commander]] and at ease. How are the [[Ghosts]] doing?”

“They are doing well sir. A little battle worn but a few days back planet side and they'll be right as rain sir.”

“Good I am glad to hear that. I have received numerous reports on you and your squad's escapades. Some real good work, especially that raid on [[Kudre]]. I know you couldn't have been very happy about [[Malachite]]'s death but we did get some useful information from him.”

“Thank you sir. And no I was not happy but it is what it is.”

“Good to hear. Now to the real reason I asked you to come here. How do you feel about your skills leading?”

I paused for a moment unsure how to answer. Did I do something wrong? Did I miss something? No it could be that he was just praising the Ghosts and I a moment ago.

“Well [[Commander]]?”

“Sorry sir. Well…I feel as though I have a decent handle on it. Why? Is there something I can improve on?”

“No no. I just wanted to see how you would respond. You have been leading the [[Ghosts]] very well and it has been noticed. We have been talking about forming a new Wing. One that is composed mostly of Marines. We would need someone to lead them. Would that be something you are interested in?”

Holy Shit! They want me to be a [[Wing Commander]]. It feels like it's only been a few months as a [[Commander]]. “Umm…Yes Sir I would be interested in it. I am honored that [[NOVA Command]] would like me for this assignment. 

“Good. I'll make all the arrangements for your new command, [[Wing Commander]].”

“Thank you sir. I won't let you down.”

“I expect you won't. Have a good day [[Archangel]].”

With that I left the Admirals office and made a straight shot back to my hab. [[Kiara]]’s going to freak out when she hears the news. I know this means I won't be on the front line as much once I find a replacement for the [[Commander]] of the [[Ghosts]], but that's a little ways down the road. Luckily I have just the guy in mind.
