Part 3 of 4

Well we made it back to [[Hurston]] that afternoon after meeting with [[ShaRroos]]. Sadly the meeting didn’t go as well as I had hoped but she did agree to pass her contact my information. Hopefully I’ll hear from them soon. I am meeting virtually with the Admiral here shortly to discuss the developments with Cepheus’s kidnapping. I would have met in person but depending on when I hear back from this mystery person, I wanted to be near home. I am planning on going off the grid to meet with them and I needed quick access to my MSR. 

When I first brought my team on board the *[[Emelia]]* we set up a nice training area in a couple of the cargo holds. I decided to head down there and get a quick workout in while I waited for my meeting. As I walked down the catwalk and saw some of the [[Ghosts]] do hand to hand combat training in one bay. I remember a few months ago when [[Scredox]] and I were doing that aboard the *Inquisitor*. God does that seem so long ago. I found my way to the cargo hold I was looking for. We had put a weight room and some cardio machines in it. I put some headphones in and hopped on the nearest treadmill. Much like cleaning my rifle, running always helped clear my mind. 

I had been running for about 20 minutes or so when I heard my mobiglass chirp. I glanced down and there was an unknown name and a message. I stopped running and took a closer look. The sender had encrypted it and it had no name, only a brief message. 

*I’ll meet you in 3 days time on [[Magnus III]]. Coordinates are attached.*

Well that was cryptic but I am not surprised. At least I will be able to meet this person and hopefully get some answers. 

I glanced up and saw I had about an hour before my meeting. Better go get cleaned up and look presentable, this meeting could be interesting. 

*One hour later*

I am sitting at my desk staring at a screen with Admiral Dolbi On the line. 

“ArchangelCorps, good to see you again.”

“Thank you sir, good to see you as well, wish it was at a better time though.”

“I hear that. I have the salvage report here. Looks like Cepheus’s ship was banged up good. Not to mention him and the cargo he was transporting are missing. I also have Fives report here and it seems like there was some mysterious ship out there. Care to tell me what we are doing to find him?”

“Sorry sir, I don’t know much more than you do on this. We are running down some leads but nothing concrete yet.”

“Hmm, how much do you know about Ceph’s past?”

“A fair amount sir.”

“Do you know he was a smuggler?”

“Yes sir I know that. May I ask what you're getting at?”

“In a minute, care to explain why his ship had a long list of modifications and why it was registered as a salvage vessel?”

“Yes sir, I gave him the green light to tweak his vessel as he saw fit. Our intentions were to get a leg up on the Syndicate. As for the registration, we figured if it was a salvage vessel it would go unnoticed better.”

“Interesting that you did not inform us of that. Is there any way that we can track who kidnapped him? Maybe starting with the people who modified his ship, they could have put a tracker on it.” 

“Sorry sir. As to tracking the modification, I have already spoken to them and have another lead that I am planning on tracking.”
“Good, keep me informed. Also, with [[Cepheus|Ceph]] having access to Malachite, and his death. And now him disappearing with special cargo. We are concerned that he may be involved with the Syndicate more than he let on.”

“I'm sorry sir, are you implying that [[Cepheus]] is a mole for the syndicate? That's ludicrous.”

“Easy there, we are asking serious questions. He has a criminal background. So he has the know-how to do this. There just seems to be a lot of coincidences with him involved. Don’t get me wrong I have faith in our Commanders but Admiralty is looking at this with a magnifying glass”

“I would put my job on the line to vouch for Cepheus. He has done nothing but help the TFA from the start.”

“I trust your gut. The question now is what are you going to do to get him back?”


“I understand sir. And like I said I have a lead I want to run down that might shed some light on this and help.  I was able to obtain a meeting with someone whom I think can help us with figuring out what this material is. But they wish to meet in private. I want to request a leave of absence for about a week to pursue this lead. During that time I will be off the grid and will be leaving the Commander of the Ghosts in charge.” 

“Where will you be meeting and with whom?”

“I would prefer not to say at this point as they are rather secretive.” Not to mention I have no idea who it is. 

“I understand, I trust that you are making the right decision. Your request is granted.”

“Thank you sir.”

“Good luck and safe flying [[ArchangelCorps]].”

“You as well sir, ArchangelCorps out.” I ended the call and leaned back in my seat. I can't believe they are questioning Cepheus’s loyalties. I hope to god he is still alive and is trying to get back. I know I have people running down leads on him but nothing is coming back. IF it was the Syndicate, which I have no doubt that it was, they are going to squirrel him away good, if not already killed him. But I am leaving that in the hands of my team. Time for me to pack up and go dark for a bit. 

I sent a message to my second to report to my office. When he arrived I explained what was happening and that he would be in charge until my return. He requested I take a couple guys with me but I quickly denied that request. This was a mission only for me to do, [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] was not to be involved. He begrudgingly understood and left. 

I packed a few things and grabbed my guns before heading up to the Hangar. I had one of our pilots take me down to my home on Hurston in the Pisces. After he had flown off I made my way into the house. I explained what was happening to my family and my wife simply said, “Be sure to come home.” She said that every time I left for a contract before [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]]. And I came home every time, god knows if I didn’t she would find my soul somewhere and kill me again. 

After my send off with them I hopped in my STV and drove out to an undisclosed hangar. I had put this hangar in when I first moved out here to keep my ships stored. One of which was my MSR, the *Outrider*. She was a beautiful ship that I used for quite a few missions back in the day. I opened the hangar bay door and parked the STV to the side. 

I then made my way to her and opened the cargo hold. I tossed my gear in, and quickly pulled up the engineering pad. The last time I used her, I purged all the lines to store her. So I walked to the hangar wall and grabbed the fuel lines to fill her back up. After topping her off I climbed aboard and made my way to the cockpit.
Sitting down in the pilot seat, I slid up to the consoles and started her up to do the preflight check. As I scrolled through the windows, I checked all of her systems. Life support, check; Weapons, check; Shields, check; fuel, full, Quantum drive, check. It appeared I was green across the board. With that down I fired her up and eased off the hangar floor. I slowly pulled out of the hangar and shut the door behind me. 

As I left atmo I pulled up my guidance. Looking at the star map I plotted a course to [[Magnus III]]. Been a long time since I had been in that system. Pretty desolate if I remember, and a great place for meetings like this. Well here we go, I heard the Quantum Drive spool up and hit the button. 

I’ll be interested to see who it is I am meeting with. The fact they are out of the system and how cryptic they are will make for an interesting adventure. With Quantum engaged I left the cockpit and headed back to the kitchen to grab me something to drink. I might as well enjoy some of this alone time before being thrown back into the fire when I get back.
