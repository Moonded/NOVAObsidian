It had been a few days since my meeting with [[Dolbi]] and the rest of the guys. We had gotten the go to raid [[Kudre]] and were doing our last preparations. Bandader was getting the rest of the Task Force up to speed on what we were up against and [[Cepheus]] was gearing up as well. All I had to do was wait. Which frankly was the worst part.  

Shortly after that meeting I contacted my guys on the ground to give them a heads up that they would have to camp out for a few more days. The two of them were good guys and I know they would keep a low profile and give me constant reports on any changes.  

When I had sent them to the mine I had also recalled the rest of the [[Ghosts]] to ensure we were prepared to assault when we got the go. The rest of the squad was already onboard the Emelia when we had our meeting. With everyone geared up and waiting there was a lot of time to kill. Some of the guys hung out in the crew quarters playing pool and shooting the shit; while others were training in the cargo bays in hand to hand combat. It was good to see this team get along and train together. I occasionally would jump in and school the guys but some of them had picked up on my skills and gave me a run for my money.  

This evening though I was sitting in my captain's quarters reading about an old sniper from back on Earth. He was a sniper who fought in what was called the Vietnam War. The sniper was [[Carlos “Lông Trắng” Hathcock]]. His nickname meant “[[White Feather]]” because of the feather he kept in his brush hat. I had grown up hearing stories of these old snipers and he was the inspiration for me learning how to be one. This man had 93 confirmed kills and one of those kills he did by shooting an enemy sniper through the scope of the enemy rifle. Reading these old stories had always been a way for me to calm my nerves.  

After I got done reading I headed to the bridge. We were positioned in orbit around [[Daymar]] waiting for the rest of the Task Force to show up. I stood there with a scotch in my hand just looking out onto the moon. I heard the door hiss open behind me and saw my LT walking up.  

“Evening Sir, just got another report from our boys on the ground. Seems like nothing has changed and [[Malachite]] is still on site.”  

“Good. We will capture him soon enough. How are the rest of the guys?”  

“Restless. We are all ready to get boots on the ground and capture this guy, not to mention we want a little action.”  

“I understand the feeling. I am not keen on just sitting around waiting but we have our orders.”  

“If we capture this guy, what are we going to do after?”  

“Well that all depends on what [[Malachite]] gives us. We have a ton of intel on this group but without him there are a lot of odd trails we would have to chase down. With him though we should be able to narrow this search and start removing them from the system.”  

“Good. When I heard what they were doing at [[the Orphanage]] I was pissed. Wish I could have been part of the assault team.”  

“You weren’t the only one that was pissed, most of us were. And don't fret about not being there for that one. We have more raids in the future that you and the rest of the [[Ghosts]] will play a major role in.”

“Good to know sir. Well I’ll be off to make sure the guys aren't being too rowdy. Have a good night sir.”  

“You too.”  

He left and I stood there for a few more minutes just thinking about what the future holds. Right now my future holds this glass of scotch and then a good night's sleep…hopefully.
