System: [[Crusader]]
Location: [[NSS Emelia]]

  

The P6-LR lays in pieces on my desk in the captain's quarters. Breaking down and tweaking this rifle always helps calm me while I wait for news. This time though it is news from my team on the ground. I had sent two of the Ghosts to go get eyes on this abandoned mine on [[Daymar]] which was supposedly the last known location of Malachite. As we waited for the news I had recalled the rest of the Squadron back to the [[NSS Emelia]]. I wanted to get everyone staged and ready so we can deploy faster if he is actually on sight. Once we get news I’ll contact Wing Commander [[BandaderArten]] and get the Task Force assembled to assault the location. But again we have to wait.  

I sit there and slowly put the gun back together, always fiddling with the trigger. I like my trigger squeeze to be light but I don't need it to be too light though that breathing on it fires it. Just as I am putting the final touches on it my [[MobiGlass]] chirps; I look down to see an incoming transmission from one of my guys, [[Durnk]].  

“Commander [[ArchangelCorps]], report.”  

“Commander myself and Swerve1991 got on site 2 days ago and we have confirmation that the target is on site. Repeat we have confirmation of the target known as Malachite.”  

“Copy that [[Durnk]]. What is the SITREP?”  

“Other than the target, we have confirmation of at least 5 others but unknown numbers in the cave. They typically have at least two on guard outside the cave at all times, no sight of enemy snipers. They also have two Cutty Blacks covered on the ground. It seems like a small force Commander, we can sneak in and get him out if you want.”  

“Negative soldier. Stay on sight, I will give you an update soon. [[ArchangelCorps]] out.”  

Finally, some good news, Malachite is on site and within our grasp. Time to give the [[Wing Commander]] a shout. I pulled up my [[MobiGlass]] and realized I had a meeting with Admiral [[Dolbi]] regarding what has been going on with the investigation.  

30 minutes later  

I am standing next to a screen that had [[Dolbi]], [[BandaderArten]] and Cepheus in it. Because of where I was I hologrammed into the meeting to give my report. Cepheus was finishing up giving his report,

“I have been working together with [[Arch]] and the [[Ghosts]] over the past few months to locate [[Malachite]]. I was tipped off by an informant of his location, and shortly after the [[Ghosts]] confirmed his location. We know he has a security detail, but we don't know its size or capability. We believe he is acting on the orders of a much larger organization, the exact size or scale of which we hope he will be able to tell us…”  

I chimed in at the tail end of this. “I can elaborate on his location and security force. About thirty minutes ago I received intel from my [[Ghosts]] on the ground. They can confirm that the target is at the [[Kudre Ore Mine]]. We also know that he has at least 5 security personnel on site but we can not confirm the number of hostiles in the cave. We also know they have two sentries on the exterior with two Cutty Black’s under tarps on the exterior as well.  

In my opinion if we bring in a few Hoplites low and fast we can overwhelm them in force fast. I can have my men on the ground eliminate the sentries just before we come into view of the location.”  

When I was done [[Dolbi]] looked just as pissed as he normally does but with this slight smirk like he wanted to congratulate us. Frankly, I was kinda worried. But he spoke up, “Well I am glad you found him now the job will be to capture him. With that I will leave the details to you three. Oh and don't screw this up, I don’t want to be doing even more paperwork from another half-assed rescue attempt.”  

With that I signed off, poured myself a glass of scotch and waited to hear from the others on what we wanted to do.
