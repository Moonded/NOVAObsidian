N-ID: 643856 - [[Wing Commander]]
Callsign: [[ArchangelCorps]]
System: [[Stanton]], [[MicroTech]]
Location: [[NSS Emelia]] and [[Delvin Scrap & Salvage]] 

I was in the mess hall with a couple of the ghosts when I felt the *Emelia* drop out of Quantum, seems like we have made it to [[MicroTech]]. I took a final swig of my coffee as I stood up, “Time to suit up guys.” Everyone took the cue and began heading to the lower deck to suit up. I made my way to my quarters and opened my locker that had my gear stowed in it. I climbed into my white [[Orc-mkx armor]] and set my helmet on the desk. I'd be going in solo to start so I pulled out my P6 that I would use for scouting, and maybe sniping if the need aroused. I also went ahead and grabbed my FS-9. I had a bad feeling about this meeting so I wanted to make sure I had enough firepower to hold my own until my team arrived if need be. With all my gear on I grabbed my helmet, tucked it under my arm and headed to the bridge. 

As I walked in our pilot was aligning the ship for our next Quantum to Euterpe. “We will be in orbit shortly sir.” 

“Understood, I’ll make my way to the Pisces, radio me when we are in range.”

“Yes sir.” With that I walked out and made my way to the technical deck where the Pisces was waiting in the Hanger. 

On our way to [[MicroTech]], I contacted a couple of my [[Commander]] in the Wing and had requested fighter and dropship support for my team. The plan was to check in every 15 minutes with my team. If I told them to come they would be at my location within 5. If for some reason I missed a check in they had orders to enter the AO and do what they do best. I don’t trust the Syndicate to live up to their word but we shall see how this goes. 

*A few moments later*

I was sitting in the [[Pisces]] when my pilot came over the radio saying we were position. Looking through the glass of the hanger I gave a thumbs up to the crew and they opened the hanger door. As it opened I powered up the engines and prepared to take flight. With the doors open I lifted off and headed down to an area about 2 kilometres away from [[Delvin Scrap & Salvage]]. The plan was to land outside the AO, conceal the Pisces and hike in on foot so as to be undetected. I wanted to scout out the area prior to putting myself in a possible kill box. 

After a short flight down to the moon, I got the [[Pisces]] stowed away and concealed. I looked out onto the horizon, took a deep breath and began walking. We had about 2 hours until the meeting. My goal was to get there in about 30 minutes and have plenty of time to scout the area. Hopefully I would be able to get eyes on the admiral and confirm that he was at the location. 

*30 minutes later*

Well that wasn't too bad of a hike. Now I was laying on a hillside about 600 meters out with a clear line of sight of most of the AO. Because of all the scrap piles it would be hard to get a good view of it all but I could see the bulk of it. As I lay there looking through my Behring 16x scope, I caught movement around one of the piles. It was a lone person moving low and slow around the area. He was the only person I saw and no other ship in the area. I wonder if the Syndicate had sent a scout as well to clear the AO and ensure we hadn't set a trap. Too bad for him that he was alone. I laid there and watched him for 15 minutes or so. When I confirmed he was alone I came up with a plan to sneak in and take him hostage. Hopefully if I had one of their guys they would be more likely to comply and give us the [[admiral]] back. With the plan laid out I started my descent into the area. Every so often I would stop to scope out the area and confirm his location, which seemed like he was holding inside the building.
I had been moving low and slow into the salvage yard ensuing that I would not be spotted. The white Armor helped blend me into the area so I felt confident that I was not seen. I made my final approach to the building and could hear movement on the top floor. As I made my way up the stairs I heard a shot and the bullet striking the metal stair in front of me. 

*Shit*, how the hell did he know I was here. The shot had come from inside the building. I pulled out my sidearm, a S-38 pistol and popped up shooting two quick rounds into the building before I made a break for some other cover. As I ran I heard the other shots ricochet off the cover next to me as I slid behind it. I heard the guy inside swear, I bet he thinks he's a hell of a shot. I lean out from the cover and pop off another couple of rounds. As we shot at each other a new sound started coming over the gunshots, the sound of [[Cutlass Black]] engines. *Shit I can't catch a break.* I shout over to him “Sounds like you friends are on their way here. Want to make this easy for me and give up?”

He responded back, “My friends have style, guess they must be yours!”

I sat there for a second, if he's telling the truth and they aren't his and I know they aren't mine, that means this guy may not be with the syndicate. Well here comes another leap of faith. I raised my hands up above the cover with my gun hanging from my index finger showing that I wasn't going to shoot. “Alright, let's stop shooting for a second then and figure this out.” Sadly we didn't get that second. We both saw the three cuttys cress the hill I came from with markings that tied them to the Syndicate. At the same time both of us said, “Shit!”

I hollered over to him, “I take it you're not a fan of them either then.”

“Nope, you?”

“Obviously not, I thought you were one of them. Seeing as you're not, could I ask for some assistance?”

“Depends on what you're asking for.”

“Well I am supposed to be making a trade with them. They have someone I want and I have something they want. What I am asking is that you lie in wait and if anything goes wrong kill as many of them as you can until my team arrives.”

“Taking care of syndicate muppets, yeah I can help with that. I’ll take cover in one of the salvage piles over there, just give me the word and I’ll start shooting.”

“Sounds like a plan.” As he begins walking away I say, “[[ArchangelCorps]] the name by the way, just in case you need to know.”

“Well met [[Archangel]], you can call me Angel” and he walked off. 

He was able to get in position before the Cuttys circled over. Two of the three landed and a small contingent of Syndicate mercenaries stepped out. I counted roughly 10-15 not including the pilots or the third cutty. 

I stood on the second level of the building as one of the [[Syndicate]] soldiers stepped forward wearing some Armor that stood out around the others. Must be the leader. “You have my [[admiral]]?”

“That depends, you have our product?”

“Only product I have is going to be used in exchange for my guy, so I ask again, where is he?”

“Look asshole, that's not how this will go down. You will give us our product and we may give you your admiral. You are outnumbered and outgunned so you are at a disadvantage.” 

He wasn’t wrong there. Calmly I lean over the ledge and say, “I don't give a damn if I am outnumbered or outgunned. I need verification that he is alive and here.”

“Oh you want verification? Fine here's your verification that he is here and was alive” Was? Shit! He waved his hand and the Cutty that was still airborne opened its side bay. I could see our admiral kneeling next to the open door, dishevelled and beaten. Then everything happened so quickly. I saw his captur raise a gun and put a bullet in his head kicking his body out the side door. My blood began to boil as I watched his body plummet to the ground.
“You just fucked up. Now!” As I hollered I could hear the tell tale sound of a railgun launching its payload. I saw the energy leave the area where that guy was hiding and rip through the head of the lead guy and then strike 2 or three guys behind him. As that happened I ducked behind cover and grabbed my FS-9. I tried to radio my team but comms had been jammed. Looking at the time I was only a few minutes away from my next check in. All we had to do was hold the ground until I missed that check in and my team came in. Easier said than done with small arms fire going off around me and the sound of a second railgun shot, taking out the third Cutty. 

From my position I began firing my LMG in short bursts. I was able to take out a couple of guys before the rest began taking cover. I could also see Angel moving down the backside of the salvage pile attempting to move position. What he didn't see was one guy working around the pile towards him. I took out the soldier as he made line of sight with Angel. He saw it happened, gave a head nod and hauled ass to cover. I looked at the time. The check in time had come and gone, my team should be in bound. As the thought crossed my mind the sound of engines could be heard. It seemed like the syndicate also heard the sound as they all began retreating towards the two cuttys on the ground. Now was my chance to take out as many as I could. I dropped to my stomach, took up a position with a clear line of sight of the closest cutty and began putting lead down range. I had taken out at least three more of their guys prior to them getting behind the ship's shields. With all their people on board they took flight and began to leave the AO. But before the second ship could turn around another railgun shot came from another pile and struck one of the ships engines. The pilot struggled to keep it level before a fourth railgun shot flew directly at the cockpit. When that shot landed the entire cutty blew up and its burning carcass fell to the ground. The last cutty was airborne and were already a couple kilometres out before a Valkyrie and a few fighters crested the hill. The Valk landed and out rolled a [[Cyclone]] TR with the [[Ghosts]] in tow. 

“Secure the area. If there is anyone left, attempt to bring them in alive.” I hollered down to my team. 

[[The Cyclone]] rolled out to drive around the perimeter, as the drove off I saw Angel walking over holding a Railgun at his side. The ghosts quickly locked on to him, but I quickly informed them that he was a friendly. 

He strode over to me, “idk where you had stowed that railgun but thanks for the support. Also, nice shot at the beginning.”

“I had stashed it before you got here. I didn't know if you would be friendly or not so I wanted to make sure I had a back up plan.”

“About that, how the hell did you know I was here?”

“Lets just say even though you did well to conceal your [[Pisces]], I was still able to pick up the faintest of signatures.”

“Hmm you’ll have to elaborate on that, but in the meantime, thank you for your assistance.”

“No problem, sorry about your guy.”

“Yeah that's not going to go well with the brass, but shit happens in battle. So what were you doing here in the first place and why are you fighting the [[[Syndicate]]]?”

“Let's just say I have a personal investment in hunting them down. As for why I am here, I had gotten a tip on some [[Syndicate]] activity in the area and came to investigate. Didn’t realize the [[Syndicate]] was in open conflict with [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] though.”

“Hmm never said I was [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]].”

“The ships that came in are all registered with [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]].”

Yet again he is on the ground and is able to scan ships, “How are you able to see that while on the ground?”

Angel just looks at me, refusing to answer.

“Ok. Seeing as we have a mutual enemy, how about we sit down and chat about the [[Syndicate]]. Always good to have allies in a fight. You mind coming up to my Carrack to chat?”
“I think I can make that work.”

“Good deal. We are sitting in orbit. You can't miss her, “

“The [[NSS Emelia]], yes, I know” he finishes my sentence.

“I’ll meet you up there after I collect my belongings and get back to my ship.” With that he headed off and began collecting gear he apparently had stashed in the AO. 

My team radioed in saying that the area was secured. I grabbed two of my guys and grabbed a stretcher. We walked over to where the admiral's body lay crumpled on the ground. We rolled his body over and put him on the stretcher. I closed his eyes before we put a sheet over him. I said a short prayer silently and had my guys stow the body in the [[Valk]]. Once we collected all of the [[Syndicate]] bodies, or at least what was left of them, we loaded up the [[Valk]] and headed off to where I had landed the [[Pisces]]. I hopped out and they headed back towards the [[Emelia]]. I uncovered the Pisces, hopped in and started her up and headed by to the Carrack as well. As I approached I radioed my crew and had them open the hangar bay for me to land. After landing and watching the hangar doors close I pulled my helmet off and took a deep breath. That didn't go as planned and now I have to report the failure to get our Admiral back, which will not be a good call. With that being said though, we may have just got another ally, which I have a sneaking suspicion he knows [[Italina]] seeing as he must have access to some weird tech. Hopefully he will be here soon and we can chat about it. 

I stepped out of the Pisces and headed back to my quarters. I stripped out of my gear and back into my [[Wing Commander]] uniform. Figured I would at least look professional for this meeting not to mention I’ll have to call my [[Admiral]] after this. As I slipped on my boots the pilot came over the comms and stated a ship was inbound and had requested permission to land on the top of the Carrack. I sent my approval and headed to the top deck to meet our potential ally.
