Beep, Beep, Beep. The alarm on my [[MobiGlass]] went off.  

I have had two full nights of sleep since being back in [[Stanton]]. [[Area 18]] is far from my home on [[Hurston]], but it is nice to have my family here for the week that Commander [[BandaderArten]] gave us, or now [[Wing Commander]]. The promotion had come through when we got back in Stanton yesterday. My family had travelled to [[Area 18]] for a short “vacation” to see me. I appreciated more than words could explain, especially after all the nightmares during our recent mission. But they were going to be heading back in a few days, so I am going to enjoy it while it lasts. We are actually going to grab dinner with [[Scredox]] tonight. He had been asking about my family on the trip back when he heard they were going to be in town.  

Before everyone wakes up though I am going to hit the gym. I have to stay in top condition since I have a feeling we will be leaving shortly after this break. Whatever is happening at [[The Orphanage]] must be getting worse because everyone seemed tense after hearing about us going back and the Commanders meeting when we got back. I have some contacts that I may reach out to get some information, but that can wait until after my family leaves. I don’t need [[Emmy]] seeing more of my past than she already has.

I quietly slide out from under the sheets not to disturb my wife, [[Kira]]. She turned over and looked at me and said, “I love you.” She knew that I was heading to work out, it was my morning ritual before my deployment, and it still is if I sleep through the night. The lights are off when I get there, and the room is empty. I always enjoy working out when the only sound I can hear is my breathing. After throwing some weights I jumped on the mat to do some tai chi. I know most find this to be odd but it’s a great way to focus and work on balance. It also is very slow moving while going through my forms. As I am working on a particularly difficult move, I hear the door open and light footsteps coming from behind me. I have a feel it [[Scredox]] trying to sneak up on me. During our time on the [[NSS Inquisitor]] I worked with him on some of my more stealth moves. I continued as if I didn’t hear him to make him think he is going to catch me off guard. As he approaches, he tries to wrap his arms around me, but I pivoted at the last second tossing him over my shoulder to the ground.

“How do you do that” he asks.

I chuckle as I pull him up. “I heard the door open when you came in. Shy of that it was all timing and patience.” The two main focuses I have to have in order to be a good marksman. I will say though he has been getting closer to catching me off guard lately. Only reason he didn’t this time was that small squeak of the door hinge.

“One of these days I am going to get you.”

“I have no doubt that it will happen, just as I have no doubt you will beat the Commanders score sometime. You still on for dinner tonight? I know Emmy is excited to meet some of my team.”

“Of course, I am. Can’t wait to tell her some fun stories about you.”

“Glad to hear. Well, I am just finishing up here, before I make them to breakfast. Good luck with your workout.” I waved back at him as I walked out the door. [[Scredox]] and I have become close friends on this last mission, and I am excited to have a team I can share with my family. But it is time to clean up and grab the family. I promised [[Emmy]] I would make her pancakes this morning.
