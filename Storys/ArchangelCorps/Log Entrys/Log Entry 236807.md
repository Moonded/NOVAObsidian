“Command from Recon”

“Go for Recon”

“We have made it to [[Ghost Hollow]].”

“Copy that, what do you see?”

“Seems like a relatively small team. We have only seen about 10 contacts. Looks like they brought some science guys as well.”

“Copy that, Insertion team will be there shortly.” 

“Understood sir, awaiting your orders upon their arrival. Recon team out.”

While we had waited for our recon team to get to their location I got the rest of the [[Ghosts]] together and got them geared up. I also got my gear put together. No one says a [[Wing Commander]] can’t get into the fray with his team. As soon as the call was over I made my way to the hanger bay where our [[Pisces]] awaited. 

A few moments later we had lifted off and made our way to a location about 5 kilometres out from [[Ghost Hollow]]. From there we were going to haul ass into the AO. Once landed we threw some camouflage over the [[Pisces]] and made our way to [[Ghost Hollow]]. 

20 minutes of a hard pace we were just outside the crashed reclaimer. My recon team had given us the green light to move in. We kept it nice and slow and low as we creeped around the outside of the derelict ship. As we approached we ran into a small group of three contacts wearing Armor with [[Syndicate]] markings. We quickly and quietly eliminated them and continued on. If my recon team was correct we only had seven or so more enemies to worry about. I wanted to keep the scientist alive though. As we breached the interior, we eliminated three more [[Syndicate]] soldiers making their numbers now four. 

We cleared the place room by room before coming to the last section of the ship. We made our way down the hall to the drone bay. Through the grimy glass we could see shadows in the room. Our team breached the door and eliminated the last four combatants. The two scientists had dropped to the ground when shots rang out. The insertion team quickly secured them for interrogation. 

I walked up and removed my helmet, “Hello there, understand you are currently being held by [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] and we have some questions for you. Also understand that your lives are in our hands so answer the questions honestly and I will see to it that you are left unharmed.”
The two scientists sat there glaring at me with hard stares. “Alright, first question, do you work for the [[Syndicate]]?”

“Fuck you!” as one of the scientists spit towards me. 

“Well you’re definitely not as smart as you look.” I nod my head to one of my guys and he smacks the one who spoke in the back of the head with the butt of his rifle. “Look, I would like to keep this as professional as possible but if you keep acting like that it won’t end well for you.”

The other scientist slumps his head down and stares at the ground then speaks softly, “We are only here to deliver a message.” His buddy, after recovering from being smacked, nudges him and shakes his head. 

I nod again and my guy smacks him one more time. “Go ahead and take that one outside. [[NOVA Intelligence|Intelligence]] can break him.” Two of my team pick him up and drag him outside. 

“Now, you said you’re here to deliver a message. To whom is this message for and what is it?”

With his head still down he began to chuckle and a smirk started forming on his face. And in a snarky tone he said, “To you [[Wing Commander]]. All you need to do is press the play button on that monitor over there and He will tell you.”

I stepped back for a second. They knew we were coming, I knew we had a mole in  [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] but I didn’t think it was in [[NOVA Intelligence]]. I mediately reached up and keyed my mic, “All teams check in, we have been given false intel.”

“Recon team here, we are all clear and units are still in place. We have nothing on radar scans either.”

“Copy that keep your eyes peeled. Emelia, have all air units report to the area and hold air superiority.”

“Copy that teams are moving in, we have nothing on our radar either and nothing on the stealth scanner.” 

The scientist again began to chuckle, “We don’t have back up. You will really want to take that call on the monitor. Someone will want to speak to you.”

I took a deep breath and walked over to the monitor. Pressing the button the screen came up and a familiar face was looking at me. “Daddy!” Emelia was moved away and a figure appeared with his face covered by an Aztalan helmet. “Hello there [[ArchangelCorps]]. Been a long time”

As soon as he spoke I recognized the voice, [[Commander]] [[John McCricik]], my old commanding officer from my previous unit with the [[UEE]]. The information of that team was heavily redacted so no one even knew the program existed. At this point my blood was boiling, “What the fuck are you doing with my daughter.”
“Oh just a little insurance so we know you will comply. Now I am going to keep this short and sweet. You have some things of ours, we want them back.”

“Fuck you, what made you change sides.”

He stepped back so I could see him holding my daughter and one of his friends holding my wife with guns to their heads. “Now now no reason to be hostile, like you said we would like to keep this professional. Now you will bring me that crate and you will come alone. And so help me god if you pull that same stunt you pulled on Euterpe their lives will be forfeit. Do you understand?”

If looks could kill he would be in pieces on the ground. I stared so hard on that screen trying not to lose my temper and spoke through gritted teeth, “I understand. I will come in the [[Outlander]].”

“Good, you still can follow orders. I will send you the location. You have two days, don't be late.” As soon as he was done speaking the screen went black and I felt my [[MobiGlass]] buzz. Looking down it was a message from an encrypted channel with coordinates. 

I immediately turned around, pulled out my S-38 and put a bullet in the scientist's head. He collapsed to the ground in front of my team members. They both looked at me and one spoke, “Will get her back sir. What do you need from us?”

“I appreciate it but this is something that I will have to do alone. He knows how I operate and I am not putting my family's lives in danger. For now let's get back to the ship, we need to head to [[Hurston]].”

“Understood sir.”

We made our way out of the room picking up the last scientist and headed out for a pickup. “[[Emelia]]” I choked a little saying her name, “Land in the opening and have someone take the rover to go get the [[Pisces]]. Recon team we’re done here make your way to my location for pickup.”

My orders were given and everyone began to do as they were told. As this happened I stood there looking at the night sky wondering how this had happened. How did *he* fall so far from the lawful side? How have we missed this mole so bad? And how the fuck did they get to my family? So many questions to be answered but right now I need to get things squared away and get the *Outlander* prepped.
