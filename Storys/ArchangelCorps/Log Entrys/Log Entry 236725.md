Boom!  

The shot left the chamber and headed for its target. I watched as his body crumpled to the floor only to see a little girl on the other side covered in blood.  

I snapped awake. Yet another nightmare. This time reminding me why I left the [[UEE]].  

After my parents died, I grew up roaming the streets. Ended up getting wrapped up with a gang in [[Lorville]]. Spent most of my time sneaking around the security to deliver “packages” for some of the drug runners. I was getting good at it, too good. The crew I was working with at the time decided to turn on me and gave me up to security. Just before I was sent to [[Klescher]] I was recruit by the [[UEE]]. Apparently, my skills had come across their radar, and they thought I would be a good candidate for the ==REDACTED== unit. Spent a lot of time training in stealth and marksmanship. Which is where I exceled the most at. Once I was done training, I was sent on missions that the [[UEE]] didn’t want leaked. Most were assassinations or intel gather from inside hostile compounds. They were some dirty jobs that the [[UEE]] didn’t want their hands on, but someone had to do them.  

That shot though changed my life. I was sent to take out a Drug Smuggler that had some sensitive intel on [[UEE]] forces. Sadly, I didn’t know his wife and child were going to be at the landing bay to see him off. I still remember the look on that little girl’s face as she saw her father laying there. Shit like that is what keeps me up most nights.  

Well since I am up, I guess I’ll hit the training room again. [[Scredox]] and I have been doing a lot of hand-to-hand combat. It’s a great work out and we always seem to teach one another a new trick or two. The funny thing is I seem to always scare him when I come in. Apparently, I am just too soft footed.

I walk in the training room and sure enough there is [[Scredox]], on his knees staring off into the abyss. I went ahead and snuck up behind him and put him in a headlock pinning him to the ground. I whisper in his ear, “Man, must be hard to lose twice, once to the commanders high score and to me, not able to get out of my choke.” I rolled off quickly enough though since I knew he must be exhausted and gave him a hand up. I know he wonders how I always sneak around so easily and one day Ill give him some stories but in the meantime my file is redacted for a reason, and we will keep it that way. The only other secret that I keep from the other guys are my nightmares, but I know him and the commander are aware of them.  

It may be late in the night, or early morning depending on who you talk to, but you can’t go wrong with a drink. He agrees with that assessment, and we head for the bar talking about drinks. Personally, I’m a whiskey guy but I haven’t found one on the ship yet that is as good as what I have back home. Beep, Beep, Beep, Beep, Beep goes our [[MobiGlass]] at the same time. Both of us look at each other wondering what the Commander is wanting us for at this hour; can’t be anything good. It’s been a hot minute since we had word about what was going on with the Orphanage, and I am pretty sure [[Scredox]] is hoping the same as me; that we will be heading back to Stanton to drop the hammer. So instead of heading to the bar we hung left and headed towards the Commander.
