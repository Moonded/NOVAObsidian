Well that didn't go as planned at all. I did not plan on [[Malachite]] being so prepared, but in the end we completed our objective. Sadly we lost a few good men and a couple of Hoplites. Even though we lost more than we should have, we still captured the bastard and are currently hauling his ass back to Area 18 for interrogation. We also grabbed all the [[MobiGlass]], so hopefully we get some intel off of those.

==OFFICIAL KUNDRE ORE MINE RAID OPERATION DEBRIEF, INTENDED FOR DOLBI, NOVA ADMIRAL. CLASSIFIED== 

A week ago I sent two members of the [[Ghosts]], [[Drunk]] and [[Swerve1991]], to recon the area. Two days later they gave me a report that our target, Malachite, was on site with at least 5 other contacts. The total number of ground forces were unknown at the time due to the mine structure.  

After meeting with you and the other two, [[Commander Cepheus]] and [[Wing Commander]] [[BandaderArten]], we began gathering our forces outside [[Daymar]] to prepare our assault. I left my two scouts on site to continue to gather information.  

Once our forces were gathered we used two [[Vanguard Hoplites]] to enter that AO. As we came in low over the valley floor I had my two scouts eliminate the contacts that were standing guard at the entrance of the mine. We then hovered near the entrance and deployed our Marines on the ground. The Hoplites remained on site to provide Close Air Support if needed.  

We made entry to the mine eliminating one hostile just inside the mine, but he was communicating with the other forces deeper in the mine when he was killed. This then triggered their force to mobilize. While sweeping the mine, we lost one good marine and [[Malachite]] had deployed some EMP device that screwed with [[Cepheus]]’s suit. I could tell he was still alive from that mechanical breathing of his suit but he was still not moving. Knowing he was alive I had my team push in and finish off the hostiles.  

[[Malachite]] was banged up a bit but still alive. With him being restrained by some of my guys I went to go get Cepheus back up. After getting him up though is when shit went downhill even more. My Ghosts on the surface began reporting of two cutty blacks and as they reported I could hear explosions echoing down through the cave. My guys came through and said the Hoplites had been destroyed and the cutty’s had deployed a couple dozen ground units.  

With that information I told everyone to take defensive positions. As the enemy trickled in, [[Cepheus]] eliminated a few before taking a burst to the chest, yet again not dying. While he was finishing off his attacker and healing himself the rest of the [[NOVA Marines]] eliminated the rest of the hostiles.  

We then made our way back to the surface and commandeered the two enemy [[Cutty]]’s. I sent one of them over to pick up my recon team and then we made our way back to the [[NSS Emelia]]. Once aboard there we got our wounded to the med bay and restrained [[Malachite]] in one of the Cargo bays with armed guards.  

==END DEBRIEF==

I am glad that [[Cepheus]] didn’t get banged up to much. But when I was getting him up I could help myself by jabbing him about his mechanical breathing. Little does he know that I am probably one of only a few people that would actually hear it due to my implant. But I’ll keep that to myself for a while, let him think I have a superpower.  

Now we are on final approach to [[Area 18]] and [[Cepheus]] and I were given the green light to interrogate [[Malachite]]. This should be fun.
