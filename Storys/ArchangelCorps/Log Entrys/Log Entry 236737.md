The sun is rising against a savannah horizon. I remember this morning, it was the day that I got recruited into [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]]. The morning started off fine. Emmy was running around the house and Kira was making some breakfast. It feels so long ago and yet it wasn’t. Now I am waking up in an apartment in [[Area 18]]. Reminds me a little of [[Lorville]] where I grew up, but it has its own character.  

It's been a little over a week since the assault on [[the Orphanage]]. The Rookie is healing up well. They bashed him on the head pretty good, giving him a concussion. The medic who treated him shortly after getting back to [[Area 18]] and let us know that he would recover fine. Someone though is going to have a stern talking to with that kid.  

As for me though, apparently my actions became known by some of the higher ups as I am now in the Commander in Training program. Their goal is for me to help create a squadron of marksmen and force recon specialists, but we shall see what happens. After the orphanage I think we saw the need for more marksman and over watch. Would have helped getting better intel prior to our boys getting ambushed by that tank.  

Shortly after getting back, [[Bandader]] pulled all of us that were involved into a new Task Force. Apparently the Admiralty wants us to continue our investigation into this shadow organization that is running the bigger show. We decided to call ourselves [[Task Force Azrael]]. [[Cepheus]] and I told [[Bandader]] that our first objective was to hunt down Malachite and bring him in for interrogation. The fact that he knowingly sent me into that shit show royally pissed me off and I will make him pay one way or another. Really I just want [[Ceph]] there to make sure I don’t just kill him outright.  

After that though we are going to split up and start gathering information on these other cells. I have a bad feeling that this might be a bit larger than we think it is. I also want to get in on finding out who the hell this mysterious person is in this picture that we found. His was the only picture not marked out. My gut tells me he may be a runner of some sort for them but we will have to wait and find out. [[NOVA Intelligence]] is working hard on that though.
