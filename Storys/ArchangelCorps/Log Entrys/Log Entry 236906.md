N-ID: 643856 - [[Admiral]]
Callsign: [[ArchangelCorps]]
System: [[Stanton]], [[Arcorp]]
Location: [[Area 18]], [[NOVA HQ]]

As I wandered through the streets of Area 18 on my way to my apartment where my family had gone after arriving here, my [[MobiGlass]] pinged. Well that was a quick response. As I looked down the message was not from Cepheus but from another person, one I was not expecting, [[Italina]]. 

[[Archangel]], congratulations on the promotion. After [[Cepheus]] takes over, have him get in touch.

How the hell did she know I was promoted, that just happened. Not to mention how did she know I was going to promote [[Cepheus]]. I sent a quick response back. 

Thank you. I’ll pass your message along. And we should chat soon. 

With that sent I continued home. The conversation with her will be interesting. First I want to know how she knows so much, like my file and now this promotion. Second I want to see if she has more intel on the syndicate's whereabouts, one person in particular. 

After going a few more blocks and taking a tram to this section of [[Area 18]], I finally hit the steps of our apartment building. I splurged a bit when getting it knowing the family would come from time to time. So with some extra cash we have on hand I had rented a penthouse suite. It was nice, had all the luxuries of home, shy of the view of course, but it was a good place for the family. 

As I walked in my [[MobiGlass]] pinged again, this time it was from [[Cepheus]],

Copy that, I can be there tonight, say 1900 Local. at G-Loc?

I quickly responded back confirming the time and place before opening the door. As I opened it I could hear tv in the living room. I kicked my shoes off and walked in to see Emmy sitting on the couch as Kira was standing in the kitchen. As I walked in the room [[Emmy]] turned around and ran over to give me a hug. “I haven’t been gone that long.”

“I know but I still missed you.”

I chuckled as I hugged her back, “I missed you too peanut.” I stood up and turned to Kira, “Well I have some news.”

“Please tell me it’s not another operation already.”

“No, no. But I will be back on duty soon. No this is good news. I was offered a promotion to [[Admiral]].”
Kira stopped what she was doing and smiled at me, “And? Did you take it?”

“I did. I’ll still be in the field, but not as much as before.”

“Who will take over your wing?”

“Who do you think?”

“[[Cepheus]]?” I nodded in confirmation. “He’ll do good for them”

I agreed, “Yup, I will be offering him the promotion later tonight, he will be flying in from [[Orison]].”  

“Good deal, well congratulations babe, we need to go celebrate.”

“We don’t need to go out, I can grab something on my way back from talking to [[Cepheus]], we have been away from home long enough let’s just relax tonight.”

“Sounds good to me.”

We spent the day just relaxing and getting unpacked. 6 o’clock rolled around and I received a message from [[Cepheus]], Inbound to [[Area 18]], touch down in 30 minutes. Glad to hear he made it here un-accosted, he should be coming in his new MSR. I finished a few minor things around the apartment to get us squared away before leaving. 

I took the elevator down and began the short trek over to the [[G-Loc bar]], frankly the only decent place to get a drink. It didn’t take me long to get there so I went ahead and grabbed a seat at one of the booths in the back and ordered myself and scotch. It wasn’t long after that that Cepheus walked in. 

As he sat down he waved to the bartender to get him a drink. His armoured body sliding into the seat across from me at the booth. “[[Archangel]], good to see you.”

“Glad to see you too bud, how the new ship”

“She's a beauty. Got this crazy proprietary refractive hull from [[ShaRroos]]. Totally passive stealth. Not only can ordinary sensors not see it until less than a klick away, but high end sensors, like the ones on the [[NSS Emelia]], won't see it until less than three clicks. On top of that, thrusters are boosted, I got a full remote control suite, datalink to my suit, you name it. Got the works this time… Syndicate won’t get me twice…  But enough about that, what's this new assignment you got for us? The Wraiths are itching to get to work.”

“Well, the wraiths won't be needed for this assignment, not yet at least.” I pull out the [[Wing Commander]] Insignia in my pocket and toss to him. “Catch.”
He catches it in his hand, opens his palm, the disbelief readily apparent even behind the armoured visage of the red visored [[Artimex]]. “You have got to be fucking kidding me.”  

I let out a laugh that filled the room, “Funny you should ask that, I said the same thing earlier today when they promoted me to Admiral.”

“Wait, what? You were promoted to [[Admiral]]?”

“Yup, seems like they think I’ll do well organizing the Rangers. But enough of that, what do you say? Want to take over the [[Spectral Wolves]] for me?”

“Does it come with a pay raise?” he said with a subtle head tilt, indicating his usual dry sarcasm.

“I mean…if you don’t want it I can give it to someone else.”

“Oh, no, no, no.” He looked at me, a smile apparent behind the faceplate., “I’ll take it. Can’t believe they would be ok with this following everything that has happened.”

“I think with how you have presented yourself after those events and my statement on how you are, they are fine with it. Plus they already figured I would offer it to you. You have the Admiral and Fleet Admirals blessing.”

[[Cepheus]]’ helmet visor flickered dark, as he reached up and removed the helmet, setting it upon the table. He continued,
“So what’s this mean for you? I mean you don’t fit the desk jockey job that I picture with Admiralty.”

I chuckled again, “No, they have already discussed that. I have an office here at [[NOVA HQ|HQ]] that I will probably spend the next couple weeks at, but after that I have been given the freedom to work from the field. So you and I can continue hunting the [[Syndicate]] together.”

“Good deal, don’t want you missing out on all the fun.”

“Like that's ever going to happen.”

“Well this definitely calls for a toast.” He rises from the seat, walks to the bar, and after a brief exchange with the bartender he returns with a pallet of drinks. He slides one over to me and then raises his own, “To us, for somehow getting this far”

“I’ll toast to that.” We both raise our glass and then take a big swig. “Also, got a message from a friend of ours. Sounds like [[Italina]] would like a chat with you when you get a chance. And before you ask, I have no idea what it's about.” 

“You never know with her. I shoot her a message after we leave.” 

“Sounds good. I have to set up a chat with her soon as well, need to take care of a few things before that though.”

“Sounds like a plan. Speaking of plans, what are we going to do about the syndicate?”

“Right now let's get the Wing back from their R&R. Once they are all back, we will look at the recent intel and go from there. They have been offly quiet recently.”

“Good deal, I’ll reach out to the [[Commanders]] and get everyone rounded up.”

“Look at you already taking on your role as [[Wing Commander]]. I have no doubt you will do well.”
To that he smiled.

We sat there for a little longer just shooting the shit before I told him that I needed to leave and grab some stuff for the family. After that we went our separate ways and I headed back to the apartment, making some short stops along the way to get the family all the food they liked.
