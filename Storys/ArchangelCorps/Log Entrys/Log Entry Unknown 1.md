I’m standing in the cargo haul of a cutty black as we make our way to our target. One of our moles in [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] gave us information on a mining operation out there that was being led by one of [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]]s [[Admiral]]s. The higher ups thought this would be a good time to snag and bag a bargaining chip to get the rest of our materials back. 

The plan was that one of our moles would be aboard the Admirals Mole during the operation. When they got far enough out he would give us a signal. Our forces would come in and attack them acting as a pirate org trying to harass them, what they didn't know is our mole would be drugging up their admiral. When he was drugged we would fly by and move the admiral over to our ship. We then fly like a bat out of hell out of the area before [[NOVA Security|NOVAs security]] forces could get on scene. At least that's the plan…we will see if it works. 

I hear the pilot come over the radio, “We have received the signal, our ships are inbound, we are 2 mikes out from our target.”

Well, it seems like our mole pulled it off. Let's get this admiral onboard. I feel the ship begin to slow down and the side door opens up. I could see the moon's surface flying past us as we approached our target, a Mole hovering just above a rock that appeared to be cracked. Looks like they were mining quant, too bad he won't be making that run anytime soon. I saw a hatch open as our guy waved us in. We positioned so the side door faced him and he used his tractor beam to send the [[Admiral]] over. He  hit the ground with a loud thud…bet he's happy to be drugged, I thought. Our mole then pulled himself over. 

With our target onboard we made our way out of dodge. We hit zero-g and spooled up the quantum. As we were spooling up I could see ships exiting quantum behind us, [[NOVA Security|NOVAs Security Team]], looks like you guys missed the party.
