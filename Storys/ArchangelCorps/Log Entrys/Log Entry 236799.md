Callsign: [[ArchangelCorps]]
System: [[Stanton]], [[Area 18]]
Location: [[NOVA HQ]]

I walked out of the [[Admirals]] office, that was probably one of the longest debriefs I have ever been in. Not to mention it wasn't just the Admiral there, the Fleet Admiral was also there and let’s just say he is one scary dude. Haven't seen someone so stoic since my drill instructor back when I was in the UEE, and that guy would have made anyone piss themselves. 

I headed down to the main floor and out into Area 18’s main square. Time to grab a drink and decompress a bit before we figure out our next move. I made a nice casual walk over to G-Loc, really the only decent bar around here. I sat down at the bar and ordered the best scotch they had. As I sat there sipping on my drink my [[MobiGlass]] pinged, looking down at it I saw an unknown contact sending a message to me. I sat my glass down and brought up my messages. I am glad I sat my drink down because I probably would have dropped it out of surprise. There in the holographic lettering a message I had been waiting for for some time now. 

*This is [[Cepheus]]. I’m alive. Got time for a pickup? Coordinates attached.*

Sure enough the location he sent was [[Arc L2]], well fuck that's close. I immediately stand up and haul ass to the tram. As I am running I am messaging my team and my pilot to get their asses to the Emelia as we had a pickup to do. 

The crew got to the Emelia quickly enough and we lifted off. I held off on mentioning [[Cepheus|Ceph]]’s name in my comms as I wanted to keep it under wraps. I had no doubt that as soon as [[NOVA HQ|HQ]] found out about him popping back up that they would swoop in and detain him until he was debriefed, better it be me bringing him in then someone else. We took off and headed to [[Arc L2]], which was a pretty quick quantum jump. We made port and I told the pilot to keep the engine warm as we would not be here long. 

The elevator to the station opened up and I stepped out. Making my way to the waiting area, I could see a lone figure sitting there looking out the window wearing what appeared to be [[Hurston Security Artimex armor]]. Looking him over I saw a patch job on what looked like a scorched knife hole over the heart. As I walked up he spoke, “Well aren’t you a sight for sore eyes… Ship’s still beautiful as ever though, huh?.”

“Damn straight, I take care of my ships, unlike you. Looks like your ships are only good for exploding.”

He chuckled, “Funny story about that.”

“And do I have stories for you. A lot has transpired since you went MIA and some of it isn't good. But we can talk about that after your debrief.”
“Yeah, I didn’t expect to be sleeping in my own bed tonight. Wherever you need me, I’ll go. I'll answer any questions anyone asks. I got no secrets anymore, apparently. Besides, I need to keep my friends close. Now more than ever.” 

“I can understand that. Well, let's head back to the Emelia and get this party started.” He stood up looking a little different. There was something different about him but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. We made our way to the elevator and were heading back when I heard it, the slight hmm of cybernetics. As we walked I looked over him and finally noticed the cybernetic right arm, dear god what the hell happened to him. 

As we got on board the Emelia I contacted the pilot and told him to take off and head back to [[NOVA HQ|HQ]]. Knowing he had been through some shit we made our way to the med bay. One of my medics was seated in the small office reviewing some new medical journals when he saw us walk in. He greeted us and had to take a double take when he saw [[Cepheus|Ceph]]. I turned to [[Cepheus|Ceph]] and asked, “Do you mind if he has a quick look at you just to make sure everything is up to snuff…especially with that new toy of yours?” As I pointed to his arm. 

“Yeah, a little souvenir I got during my adventure.”

I pointed to my ears, “You should have known I picked up on something like that.”

“Yeah. Not quite used to it yet… I’ll tweak it, like everything else..” He said with what I imagined would have been a smile under that helmet, then looking at the medic, “Go ahead, I just finished a few day stay at the [[Kel-To Rx]] here, so I should be clean. But do what you gotta do..” 

After about 20 minutes the medic took a deep sigh, “Looks like everything is all squared away. Not to mention some decent tech in that new arm of yours.”

I looked at the medic, “Glad to hear. [[Cepheus|Ceph]] why don't we go take a seat in my office and have a chat before we get to [[NOVA HQ|HQ]].” 

“Sounds good to me.” 

We made our way down the hall to my office and promptly shut the door behind us. He sat down in one of the chairs as I leaned against the desk running along the backside of the office. “So before we get there is there anything I should know?”

“Depends on what you want to know.”

“Well the big questions that I need to know are: One, where the hell have you been; and second, are you compromised?”

“Well. I’ve been stuck in the galaxy’s armpit we call [[Pyro]], and no, I’m not compromised. Even if I was you’d never know… Buuut, I hope you trust me enough to believe me. I wasn’t gone for that long out of my own free will.”
“[[Pyro]], are you fucking kidding me?”

“Nope, and just so you know it's just as pleasant as you would expect.”

I chuckled, “Sounds about right. Now as for the trust, I have always had faith in you. Been holding onto that with the debriefs that I have had to deal with. Speaking of debriefs, I should contact [[NOVA HQ|HQ]].”

I brought up my MobiGlass and typed in the Admirals contact:

[[Admiral]], I have good news. [[Cepheus]] is back in system and I have him onboard the [[Emelia]]. We will be coming to [[NOVA HQ|HQ]] shortly. I will bring him to the interrogation centre as soon as we arrive for an official debrief. 

After sending that I walked over to the small bar I had and poured myself a big glass of scotch. Seeing as my last drink was interrupted and we were going to have a very long debrief here soon I could use it. After pouring my glass I sat down at my desk and just looked into the glowing red eyes of the new [[Artimax]] suit that he was wearing. “Well here's to a long afternoon of talking to the admiralty…again.” [[Cepheus]] raised a hand just as I was about to take a sip, “Got any spare drink for your long lost buddy?”
