System: [[Crusader]]
Location: [[Voyager Bar]], [[Orison]]

  

It’s been a few years since I have been on [[Orison]]. Brought the family here one year for a vacation. [[Emmy]] loved all the parks and fountains. She said, “This is the most beautiful place dad. Other than our home, obviously.” She was right though, not a lot of places could match the peace and quiet of home, but [[Orison]] was a close second. This time though I was not here for sightseeing, [[Cepheus]] had contacted me and said he had some intel on a possible location in the [[Crusader]] System. Lucky for me I was already here knowing that it was home to a few [[Malachite]]'s hiding places. I had already scouted out a few locations but had found no evidence of him being there. Hopefully [[Cepheus]] has something. I told him to meet me at the Voyager Bar when he got settled.  

A few hours later  

I was sitting at the bar just looking out at [[Orison]] lost in my own thoughts when [[Cepheus]] walked up.  

“Evening [[Ceph]],” I said as he was a few steps behind me.  

“How in the hell did you know it was me?”  

“You have a distinct breathing sound with that mask on, gives you away. Might want to see about tweaking it a bit to help remove that.”  

“I already tweaked it to be basically silent, so either you have super hearing or you’re screwing with me.”.”  

I chuckled, “Nah, it's not some superpower, just used to listening for the most minuet sounds. So, you said you have some intel on [[Malachite]]’s whereabouts?”  

It had been a couple months since we last talked about Malachite. Both of us had been dealing with our new Commander duties. I had been training my new squadron, the Ghosts. Lot of great guys signed up to become part of my force recon squad.  

“Yeah, one of my contacts let slip that there was some action over at a cave on [[Daymar]]. Some old Mine that was closed or so they thought. I know you said he had some hiding places out here, does that one ring a bell?”  

“Actually it does. As far as I know he hasn't used it in a long time but I knew some other shady guys that had used it to hide out after a job. Might be a good place to check out. I’ll send a couple of my guys to go scout out the place and see if there's any movement going on there.”  

I brought up my [[MobiGlass]] and contacted a couple of my squad members.  

[[Ghosts]], I am requesting you in [[Crusader]]. I need you to go to [[Daymar]] and scout out the [[Kundre]] Ore Mine for an enemy combatant. Attached is an image of the target. Approach the AO with caution. Do not get seen. Report back to me as soon as you are done. [[ArchangelCorps]] Out.  

I looked back up from my [[MobiGlass]] and let [[Cepheus]] know that the message had been sent.  

“Sounds good. Once we have confirmation let's make contact with [[Bandader]] and get an assault force put together. Luckily this time we have some time to plan. We aren't losing any more marines to a trap.”  

“Agreed. I want to get in and get out quickly and efficiently. They aren't expecting us so we should be able to get the drop on him.”  

We sat there for another hour or so shooting the shit and having some drinks. It was good to be able to relax, even if it was only for a few hours. After we were done I headed back to my ship, the [[NSS Emelia]], an [[Anvil Carrack]] that I have been using as the FOB for my squadron and my search for Malachite. It's a good ship, a little big for what we are doing but it has its benefits.  

Hopefully my guys get to the mine quickly. I want to get [[Malachite]] in custody, like yesterday. He has a lot to pay for.
