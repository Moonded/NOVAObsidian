N-ID: 643856 - [[Admiral]]
Callsign: [[ArchangelCorps]]
System: [[Stanton]], [[Arcorp]]
Location: [[Area 18]], [[NOVA HQ]]

It's been several months since my encounter with [[John McCricik]], my former [[Commander]] when I was with a clandestine group in the [[UEE]]. [[Task Force Azrael]], [[TFA]], has been busy hunting down the Syndicate, or at least trying. It seems like they are starting to go underground a bit since our last few scrimmages. [[The Spectral Wolves]], my wing, has been doing well hunting them down and [[Cepheus]] has made a full recovery from his expedition and has been released for full deployment with the [[TFA]] again. 

I had been hanging around Hurston the last week finalizing some plans for new security measures at my home when the [[Admiral]] contacted me. I was to report back to [[NOVA HQ]] for a meeting with him and the [[Fleet Admiral]]. Seeing as my MSR was destroyed I needed a new ship. Lucky for me I had picked up a Drake Corsair from an old smuggling friend. Ship was in good shape, but I figured I would commission a few upgrades here soon. As I walked towards the parked ship the back ramp opened up and Emelia ran out. “Hey dad, are we leaving?”

“Yup heading back to [[Area 18]].” As we walked in I hit the ramps control and it lifted. Kira was standing in the doorway leading to the crew quarters. As we walked through the ship I said, “Sorry for the living space, I promise when we get back to [[Area 18]] it will be better.”

“It's fine babe, you don't have to apologize every time. I know this is only for a short time.”

“Yes but y’all deserve better. Plus I have something waiting in a hangar there that I think you and Emmy will like.”

[[Emmy]] perked up, “What is it?”

“It's a surprise but I am sure you will like it. For now though go strap in we will be taking off in a minute.” She ran off and found her seat, while Kira and I headed for the cockpit. It wasn't long before we were in quantum and heading to Arcorp.

As the quantum drive spooled down I made contact with [[NOVA HQ|HQ]] to inform them I was in bound. I was told that as soon as I landed to make my way to the Fleet Admirals office in [[NOVA HQ|HQ]]. I had only met the Fleet Admiral a hand few of times, all for [[TFA]] related stuff. So as we landed and grabbed our bags I kissed Kira and Emmy who were heading to my apartment that I kept here for work. 

I made my way to [[NOVA HQ|HQ]] and headed up to the [[Fleet Admiral|Fleet Admirals]] office. As I approached the secretary outside saw me and smiled, “They are waiting for you inside.”
“Understood, thank you.” I made my way inside. The office was spacious with a sitting area on one side and a large desk on the other backed up against some windows. Behind the desk was the [[Fleet Admiral]] and sitting across from him was the [[Admiral]]. They were talking as I walked in but stopped and looked towards me. They both stood up and the [[Fleet Admiral]] walked around the desk reaching a hand out, “[[ArchangelCorps|Archangel]], good to see you again. I hope the family is doing well.”

I grabbed his hand and gave him a firm handshake, “Good to see you as well sir. And the family is doing well.”

He gestured towards the sitting area, “[[Whiskey]] right?,” as he poured a few glasses of amber liquid. 

“Only thing that's good enough.”

He chuckled, “A man from my own heart. How are things going with [[the Spectral Wolves]]?,” he asked as he sat down. 

“They’re doing well. Staying busy. We have rooted out a few smaller cells but nothing of interest has turned up.”

“Good deal. Well you’ll be needing to find someone else to run the wing for the indefinite future, as we have a new assignment for you.”

“Understood sir, I have some people in mind. What will my new assignment be?”

The Fleet Admiral walked over to his desk and grabbed a small box. Walking back to me, he handed the box to me. “First, we think you have done well leading [[the Spectral Wolves]]. The Sniper program you and the [[Ghosts]] have created have definitely helped the Ranger on the ground. An opening has recently occurred and we think you would be the best fit for it.”
I opened the box and sitting there was the Admiral rank insignia. I looked up in disbelief, “You’re joking right?”

The [[Fleet Admiral]] chuckled and looked towards the Admiral [[sitting]] there. He spoke up, “I told he wouldn't expect it.” He then looked at me, “No, we aren’t joking. We thought you would do well helping lead the Ranger Division. So what are your thoughts?”

“Well I appreciate the offer sirs.”

The [[Fleet Admiral]] spoke up, “Before you finish that sentence, just know I have no doubt you don’t want to be sitting behind a desk all day. We have already discussed it and have no issue with you working from the field seeing as you are one of the Task Force Leads against the [[Syndicate]]. Being an Admiral will also give you a bit more freedom with your forces.”

“Seems like you two already thought about what I would say. I guess I have no reason not to say yes.”

“Good, glad to hear it. Your promotion will be effective immediately. We have an empty office here at [[NOVA HQ|HQ]] already set aside for your new position. The only thing left is to find someone who will take over the Spectral Wolves for you. I assume you already have someone in mind.”

“Yes sir I do.”

The [[admiral]] spoke up again, “Let me guess, [[Cepheus]].”

“You know me so well sir. Yes I think [[Cepheus]] would do well. He already knows the squads well enough seeing as he runs our deployment squad. He’s a natural leader and he is trustworthy.”

“Well then,” as the Admiral hands me another box, “You might as well give him the promotion yourself.”

I took the box nodding my head, “It would be my pleasure.”

We talked for another 30 minutes or so about some operational items and what my new role would entail. As I walked out of the [[Fleet Admiral]]’s office the secretary smiled, “Congratulations [[Admiral]] [[Archangel]]”

I smiled back, “Thank You.” I walked towards the elevator in disbelief, this was not what I was expecting to happen today. I will say it will be nice to have a more “office” job, at least for the next few months while I get my family squared away. 

I guess I should message [[Cepheus]], I would like to offer him his promotion either tonight or tomorrow. God I hope he says yes. I think he would do well, plus it would keep our crew together a little longer and allow us to continue our plans for the [[Wing]]. I pulled[ ]up my [[MobiGlass]] and sent him a message. 

[[Cepheus]], if you’re around [[Area 18]] we need to meet. Preferable tonight, but tomorrow will work too. Just got a new assignment for us, should be a good one. 

Now it's time to wait.
