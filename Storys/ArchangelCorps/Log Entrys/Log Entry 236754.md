Location: [[Savannah]], Home

  

The sun was rising on the savannah on Hurston. It was another calm quiet morning back at home for some R&R. Most of the [[Ghosts]] had gone to [[Lorville]] to spend their time there. A few of them had decided to stay here with me and the family. They were all currently in the kitchen telling stories of our travels, the action that had been had. [[Emmy]] was eating it up. The smile and the laughter coming from her just made the universe a better place.  

I made my way back into the house after having my morning coffee on the porch. As I walked in I could hear [[Durnk]] talking of this operation where part of our squad was pinned down and wounded.  

We had split into two fire teams. One fire team was made up of myself and two others and we had been providing overwatch while the other fire team made their way into the structure. What we didn’t know is that they were waiting for us. When my guys had cleared the building and grabbed the information we were after they began to make their way out of the structure. At that moment a group of 10-15 enemy hostiles popped up from their hiding places and began firing on the fire team. My team had decent overwatch and had begun to eliminate the enemies but there were some we could not see. So I left my two guys on overwatch telling them to watch my back and I began my approach. As I ran down I took off my 16x scope on my P6 and flipped up the iron sights. I snuck up behind where the enemy had taken cover. One by one I silently eliminated them with a single shot from the P6 until all the enemies were dispatched. Once all of them were done, I made my way to where my guys were pinned down and called in our extract.  

[[Durnk]] always told this story when he got a chance. It was one of his first missions with the [[Ghosts]] and after that he had started practicing with the P6 like his life depended on it. He has definitely perfected its use, more so than I thought he would at the start.  

“Don’t listen to him [[Emmy]], he likes to indulge on this story a bit.”  

“Oh come on Commander. You were awesome that day. I have never seen someone use the P6 like it was a CQB weapon.”  

“I have only used it like that a hand few of times.” I looked at [[Emmy]] with a grin, “Your dad was pretty awesome though,” and then I winked at her. She laughed so hard and so did the guys.

Kiara had made breakfast for everyone so we sat around the table eating and just having a good morning, until my [[MobiGlass]] chirped. A message popped up on it.  

Commander [[ArchangelCorps]]. We have some devastating news. [[Malachite]] was assassinated in his cell. Contact [[NOVA Command]] for details.  

How the hell does that happen? I stood up from the table with an angry look, “Excuse me, I have to make a call.”  

“Everything good sir?”  

“Not in the slightest, but we will figure it out.”  

I made my way to my office and placed the call. Admiral [[Dolbi]]’s secretary answered the line. “Good morning Commander [[ArchangelCorps]].”  

“Morning, can you patch me through to the Admiral?”  

“Yes sir, one moment.” A few moments later Admiral [[Dolbi]] was answering.  

“Arch sorry to bother you on your R&R but I have some bad news. [[Malachite]] was found dead in his cell early this morning. From what we can tell the Syndicate is the one who did it.”  

“Sir, are you saying what I think you're saying?”  

“Yes, I believe we have a mole inside [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]]. From here on out all information about the Syndicate and our actions will be classified. The Task Force, myself and a few select members on [[NOVA Intelligence]] will be privy to information about our actions.”  

“Copy that sir. What do you want us to do?”

“Finish your R&R, you and your guys need it. When you're finished follow up with [[NOVA Intelligence]] on other Syndicate locations and continue your hunt for their main base of operations. I will have some people working to find this mole as well. If you find any information at their bases about NOVA let me know.”  

“Will do, sir.”  

“Good deal. Enjoy the time with your family. [[Dolbi]] out.”  

The line went dead and I was standing in a quiet office. I knew the [[Syndicate]] was good but damn infiltrating [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]]. Not to mention as much as I wanted to kill Malachite I can’t help but feel some sort of loss. Maybe the loss of someone I used to call a friend or just maybe the loss of satisfaction from killing him myself. Either way he was gone and now we have two massive endeavours. First, to continue eradicating the Syndicate from Stanton. And second, to find this mole before they cause anymore trouble. Both were going to take time. But it can wait a few more days.  

I reached into my pocket and retrieved the key that we had gotten off of Malachite’s LT. Now that he's dead it may take a lot longer to find out what this damn thing goes to.  

I walked back into the dining room and everyone turned. “So what's the scoop sir.”  

“Nothing to worry about right now. We will deal with it in a week. Now who's ready for a hunting trip?” 

Emmy jumped out of her chair “Me, Me, Me!”  

“I figured as much. You guys in for a couple of days in the brush?”  

The guys all chimed in “Hell yeah!” They stopped as [[Kiara]] looked at them. [[Durnk]] chimed in “Sorry ma’am.”  

“It’s fine but you do it again and my husband won't be able to save you.”  

I chuckled as I walked out to the shop to start packing up our rover for the trip. It would be good to get out in the brush and have a few days of peace before the battle starts back up again.
