System: [[Hurston]], [[Hurston]]
Location: Home

***Fifteen years prior***

*“Who is he?”*

*“His name is [[Mik Kovac]]. Everyone calls him [[ArchangelCorps]] though, has something to do with an angel of protection or something.”*

*“What’s his story?”*

*“Well his father was a member of [[Hurston Security]] and his mom was a nurse at the hospital in [[Lorville]]. Dad was killed by some druggy and mom ended up killing herself a year later. After that he got in with the wrong crowd becoming a thief and a courier for one of the [[Lorville]] smugglers. Word is he got pretty good at being a ghost until one day his crew decided to double cross him. Prior to him moving to [[Klescher]] one of the [[UEE]] officers noted his skills and convinced him to come to boot camp. From his score thus far and what his drill instructors are saying, he’s slated to be the top of class as well as being one hell of a marksman to the point that they are sending him to Sniper School.”*

*“Sounds like you have found us a good candidate then.”*

*“I thought so [[Commander]].”*

*“We will keep an eye on him.”*

***One year later***

*I stood there in my Drill Instructors Office at the [[UEE Marine Sniper School]]. “[[ArchangelCorps]]. I pulled you in here today to meet someone. They are looking for some new recruits and are looking for the best. I would like you to meet [[Commander]] [[John McCricik]].”*

*“Pleasure to meet you sir.”*

*Sitting in front of the desk a tall, well built man stood up. His head shaved clean to the point you could damn near see your reflection. He turned, looking at me, and gave a smile and a nod. “The pleasure is all mine. I have heard a lot about you and my team has had an eye on you for a while. Tell me [[ArchangelCorps]], why did you join the [[UEE]].”*

*“Honestly sir, it was either this or prison, and I’d rather not go to prison.”*

*“Fair enough. What if I told you your skills that you developed on the streets plus what you have learned in boot camp and here could go to help the greater good of the universe. And feel free to speak freely, I want you to be honest.”*

*“Well sir, I’d think you would be a bit ambitious and naïve to think that one person could ‘help the greater good of the universe.’ Not to mention my skills would be better suited for the military.”*

*He chuckled, “You’d be right thinking that, but you wouldn’t be the only one. You would be part of a larger network of people helping with this. And frankly your skills would come in perfect for the jobs you would be doing.”*

*“So I take it this is some clandestine military group?”*

*“You’d be correct. We work for the [[UEE]] but we are far enough away from them that their image is not spoiled by our work.”*

*“What would I be doing?”*

*“You would be helping clean up messes, similar to the mess that got your father killed. You’d be dealing with smugglers and murders, amongst other missions…”*

*I stood there listening to him, when he finished I stood in silence looking at him to see if he was genuine about this offer. And frankly I couldn’t tell if he was lying or not. Finally he asked, “So, what do you think? Would you be interested?”*

*I looked him hard in the face, “When do I start?”*
Present date

The dust cleared as the [[Pisces]] that dropped me off took off. Thinking back to that day when I first met [[Commander]] [[McCricik]] just pissed me off even more. I walked towards my house and saw the door was ajar; I didn’t know what to expect there. As I walked in, I could see the place had been tossed, they were searching for the crate. Obviously the Syndicate thugs who grabbed my family weren't that smart, why the hell would I leave that in my family home. 

I shut the door behind me as I fully entered the house. And picked up a picture frame that laid on the floor. Flipping it over in my hands I saw it was the picture of Kira and I holding [[Emmy]] for the first time. The joy that was had that day. I sat the picture down on the dining room table and made my way to the garage where my STV was parked. Hopping in the front seat as the garage opened I eased out and shut it up again. Once the door was shut I stepped on the gas and pulled up next to the crate to load it up. After that I floored it heading out into the savannah where my hangar was located. 

I typed in a code on my dash and the hangar doors in the side of the hill began to open. By the time I got to them they had opened just enough for the STV to slide in. I pulled up next to the workshop located in the hangar. I still had another day before I was to meet [[McCrick]] and I planned on using that. Having pulled up to the workshop, I turned off the STV and pulled the crate off. It was time to do some shady work on this. 

It's been a hot minute since I made an [[IED]], but that wasn’t a skill I forgot. I walked up to the workbench and started pulling down the tools I needed. My plan was simple, I was going to rig up a pressure sensor to trigger the explosive. I would squirrel the [[IED]] in the middle of the crate between some of the stealth material. When they went to unload the crate it would trigger the explosion. I was also planning on packing it with enough explosive to level a small building, just a little something to say “Fuck You” to the [[Syndicate]]. 

As I was working on the circuitry I heard the sounds of a ship landing nearby. I set my tools down, grabbed my [[Demco LMG]], and walked out of the hangar as a dust cloud blew past me and I saw the shimmer of a ship decloaking. It was an MSR that appeared to have stealth tech on board. As the bay door opened I raised my rifle towards it and shouted, “If you are part of the Syndicate you came to the wrong spot. You’ll die before you even take one step on that ramp.”

A familiar voice shouted back, “Easy friend. No need to start shooting.”
The voice was Angel’s and sure enough that same armoured man that I met not long ago began walking down the ramp. “First, how the hell did you find this place? And Second, why are you here?”

“Heard what happened, sorry I couldn't get here sooner to stop them. Figure it best to check what you're planning as it's your family. As for knowing where you were, I had gotten here shortly before you to scope out the area. Ended up following you here.”

I lowered the LMG, I gestured to him to follow as I turned around and walked back into the hangar. “I am planning on getting my family back and I plan on leaving a little present for our ‘friends’ when they take it.”

We walked back into the hangar, Angel saw the explosive sitting on the workbench, “Well that looks like a decent gift. Where you planning on hiding it?”

“My thought was to hide it between the plates. I figured if its stealth tech it might keep it hidden.”

He walked over to the crate and lifted one of the plates. “Well from what I know about it, that should work well. Mind if I stick something in there as well?”

“What are you thinking?”

“Since you plan on giving this to them, we might be able to kill two birds with one stone.”

I could tell what he was thinking. “You want to put a tracker in it. Your thinking that they’ll take it back to one of their facilities and it would help you and [[Italina]] destroy those locations.”

“Exactly. Figured this could be a good opportunity for all of us.”

“Fine by me, but when you find that location give me a heads up and we will rain hell down on them together.”

“Fair enough.” He pulled out a small tracker from a hidden pocket on his gear and placed it deep in the crate between two sheets. “What do you need help with?”
“Well I could use you and that ship of yours as backup in case this goes south. They want me to come alone, but if you stay stealthed in that ship and shit goes down some, well, I want you to blow a crater that will last a lifetime. If there is any semblance of the man I used to know, he won't hurt them and this should go smoothly, but I don’t know what he has become.”

“Understandable. Where we heading?”

“[[Outpost 54]] on [[MicroTech]]. I would suggest getting there before me so as to not raise suspicion.” I picked up the pressure sensor I had been working on and moved it over to the crate to install it. “I’ll give you a ping when I am in bound.”

“Easy enough. You sure you can set that up properly?”

I looked up from where I was installing the trigger and in a short snappy tone said, “Yeah I am sure.”

“Ok I’ll leave you to it then.” As he walked away he looked over his shoulder “See you on the other side.” Then he turned and walked out.

I was alone again in the hangar and the trigger system was almost mounted, time to install the explosives and then head out. I’m coming Kira and Emmy.
