Well we just dropped off Cepheus at [[Orison]] so he could get some R&R before his next “job.” I know damn well what he’s going to do and I wont fault him for it, but I’ll be keeping a close eye on his location in case he needs backup. 

As the cargo ramp began to close I turned around and headed back to my quarters. I had already told the pilot to make their way to [[MicroTech]]. We had gotten word of some criminal group taking over a settlement at Ghost Hollow. My goal was to get in orbit and send in the Ghosts for a recon mission. If these guys were [[Syndicate]] I wanted to know why they were hanging around a crashed Reclaimer. Was there something there we didn't know about? 

I took a seat at my desk as my second in command, the team lead for the recon team, came in. “What do you got for me?”

“Well, I reached out to [[NOVA Intelligence]] and pulled the maps on [[Ghost Hollow]]. Overall should be an easy recon. The place is surrounded by woods and there are a couple of decent cliff sides that might give us a good vantage point.”

“Good. Get the recon team ready. We will deploy 10 kilometers out so y’all will be hiking in.”

He chuckled as he said “Understood sir, we’ll pack the good boots.” 

“Good. While y’all are playing in the woods I’ll get our insertion team ready. Once we get solid intel from your team we will go in at night and figure out what they are doing there. When the time is ready we will eliminate the hostiles and get as much intel as we can. Something tells me we are missing something.”

“Copy sir, the teams will be ready.”

As he walked out I sent my plans to the admiralty. I know some of our recent incursions have not gone as planned but I want them to know that TFA isn’t quitting. We will root out every syndicate operation in Stanton for good. 

I felt the Quantum drive spooling up on the *[[Emelia]]*, once more into the fray.
