I spent all night finalizing the explosives in the crate. With the tracker in place and the pressure sensor hidden deep inside it was ready to drop off. I slid it onto a small hover cart and moved it into the MSR’s hangar bay. Once secured I closed the door and headed to the cockpit. 

Sitting down in the pilot seat it turned and slid forward. Rubbing my hands across the console I whispered to myself “once again into the unknown old friend.” As the ship turned on I ran some quick checks to make sure things were still good after our last flight. Everything checked out, which I wasn’t surprised by. I lifted off and headed out of atmo. Plugging the course into navigation, I spooled up the quantum and flipped the switch. 

On the flight there I sat in the pilot seat staring at a picture of [[Kira]] and [[Emmy]]. I spent most of my life only worrying about myself until the day I met her. She changed my view of the world, gave me a reason to live, then she gave me a daughter. [[Emmy]] brought more life to me. I could imagine how much that wry smile from that little girl could light up the darkness of the world. Because of her the hardness that came from killing melted away. Even though I felt like I had become more soft, more caring of the people around me, the darkness that I once was still lingered, still haunted me and the events that have progressed thus far have shown me that I need to let some of that darkness free in order to truly protect my family. What has transpired so far will not happen again. The Syndicate will pay for what they have done. 

My mind cleared once again when I heard the console ping as we approached [[MicroTech]]. I sat the picture down, soon you will be back with me. There was a chirp from my [[MobiGlass]], I looked down to see a message from [[Angel]], “On site and in position. Currently no one is here. I’ll be on encrypted comms, I’ll be listening and ready if you need assistance.”

Damn, he made it there quick, glad he is on our side. I did a slow fly over the area, and sure enough no other ships were around and no signatures were popping up on radar. Seems like it's time to sit this bird down. I landed [[The Outlander]] just to the side of the structure. As I landed my [[MobiGlass]] pinged. Glancing down, I saw the message “Take the package inside and wait.” Knowing that Angel could hear everything I spoke out loud, as if to myself, “Sounds like they have someone watching.” I went ahead and wheeled the package off the ship and made my way inside. 

As the airlock hissed open the lighting barely turned on, leaving the room rather dim. The space was in disarray but there was a table and a few chairs. I sat the package down in the centre of the room and took a seat at the table to wait. 

I didn't have to wait long as only a few minutes went by before I heard the engines of a [[Cutlass Black]], maybe two. I remained seated knowing that [[McCricik]] would kill my family if I did anything. The airlock hissed again as it cycled through. As the door opened three figures stepped in. The two in the front made a quick sweep of the room. The third being none other than [[McCricik]] himself. He pulled the chair opposite of me and sat down. “Long time Arch, I see you can still follow orders.”
“Cut the crap John. Your package is right there, now where is my family?”

“In good time bud.”

“I’m not your bud.”

“Sure thing. Before you get your family I have to make sure you aren’t fucking with me.” As he said this he waved at one of the others. The smaller one walked over and popped the lid off. They lifted the first two plates and examined them, then set it back down, shutting the package again. As they finished, they looked over and nodded, “Appears to be all there and in good condition.”

“Well that's good to hear. Now,” turning back to me, “about your family.” He reached up to his comms, “Bring them in.”

It felt like eternity as the airlock cycled yet again. Finally the door opened and there were five figures. Three wearing full Armor surrounding the other two. The armoured figure in the back gave the little one a nudge to move forward. Seeing this I about jumped out of my seat and [[John]] said “Easy now, don’t want anyone getting hurt.”

As they came into the light I could see a bruise across my daughters face, “What the fuck John you said they wouldn’t be harmed.”

“That I did, but like father like daughter. She was a handful and needed a reminder of who was in charge.”

“You’ll pay for that.”

“Maybe, but not today. Today we are going to walk out of here. You will stay in this building until you are given a signal. At which point you’ll be free to leave.” As he spoke he waved a hand to one of the guards, “Take the package to the ship, we’ll be leaving soon.” Two of the guards moved the package into the airlock and cycled it.

At this point he waved for my wife and kid to come closer, “Go ahead and join your husband over there.” As they shuffled their way over he stood up and walked towards the airlock. They got close enough that I wrapped my arms around them and whispered, “I'm so sorry, it will be over soon.”

As the airlock opened again, John and the rest of his guards stepped in. The door began to close and John looked at me and said, “Be seeing you soon Arch.” With that the door shut and the airlock cycled for a final time.
I stood there for a few minutes just holding both of them, tears rolling down my daughters face. I knelt down, whipped the tears off her cheek, and said, “Everything will be ok. You are safe now.” I heard the engines of the cutlass black take off and begin to leave, but before they were gone I heard the familiar sound of a volley of missiles being launched. That fucker wouldn’t! Sadly he would though, I heard the missile strike The Outlander outside, the explosion rocked the building. I squeezed Emmy and Kira and pulled them towards the opposite wall, luckily the blast didn't cause too much damage to the building, none of the shrapnel made it to the room we were in. 

Kira looked at me, “Please tell me that wasn’t the only way out of here.”

“God willing, no it won't be.” Sure enough as I said that my [[MobiGlass]] pinged. You alive in there?

“Yeah Angel we are alive, could use a pick up though”

His voice came over the comms, “Copy that, once their ships are off the radar I’ll head that way.”

“Appreciate it.”

Emmy spoke now, “Is that one of the Ghosts?”

“No honey, he’s a friend though, and has helped your dad more than enough already.”

Kira spoke next, “What are you going to do about John?”

“What do you think I will do?”

“I know what you want to do, and I fully support you. That bastard hurt our daughter, so just promise me one thing.”

“What's that?”

“Promise me that you will make it slow for him.”

With a grin on my face I spoke, “I can promise you that he will regret taking the two of you.”

She smiled at me, grabbed our daughter and we hugged longer than before. [[Angel]] came over the comms, “We are clear, I’ll be on site in two minutes. Be prepared to leave quickly.” 

“Copy that we will be waiting.” As we walked out of the station I looked over to the wreckage of [[The Outlander]], well that sucks. She was one of my favourite ships. Lot of memories were made onboard her. But I would gladly pay that price for my family's safety anytime.
