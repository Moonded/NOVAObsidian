Part 1 of 4

[[Fives-Fett]] just left the *[[Emelia]]* after I had requested him. I had set up a notification system to ping me if any of the TFA ships were involved in anything major. The ping I got about the Point of No Return being destroyed with no one found on board was obviously something major. He informed me that he had arrived on scene to a distress signal and found the ship destroyed and no [[Cepheus]] about and no cargo. He also informed me of an [[MSR]] that was seemingly cloaked to his sensors, which was rather concerning. The salvage team was on site and was doing their job. I had requested that they send me a report when they were finished.

While I waited for that I figured I would take a look at the cargo he left with me. If they took it along with him it must be something important.
I made my way out of the Captains quarters and down the hall to the elevator. I had stored them in the cargo bays out of the way. He had left two crates with me and said they were both the same stuff. I cracked open the first crate to find a stake of metal plating. But this wasn’t like any metal I had seen before…or was it. Something seemed familiar about it. I picked up one of the pieces and looked closer, it seemed to shimmer in the light. I decided to look into it further and took it with me to the technical deck, where I would go to the repair room and inspect it a bit better.

As I sat there in the repair room looking at this metal it dawned on me where I had seen it before. It was ten years ago on a classified mission.

*I sat in the pilot seat of my [[MSR]] the [[Outrider]] with a dossier of a pilot sitting in front of me. It stated that this pilot had been working for a lot of different companies acting as a test pilot for some new ships. Sadly, one of these companies was not thrilled that he was working with others and had requested that we eliminate him. So here I was on my way to his apartment to put him in his grave.*

*I landed on the roof of his building and made my way to the forty-first floor. The target’s floor had more security than most, so I was going to have to sneak in. One of the maintenance shafts on the forty-first floor led down to the floor below and had no security, a fatal oversight that his security staff didn’t think about.*

*I slid down and wiggled myself into the shaft with my gear in a bag behind me. Once I made it to the maintenance closet, I put the rest of my gear on. This was going to be a simple mission, but I always come prepared for the worst. I had a P4-AR with a suppressor strapped to my back and an S-38 with a suppressor on my thigh. I brought up my scanner and a fiberoptic camera to check the hall, only one enemy target between me and the target's room. Seems like their security is light for tonight, makes my job easier.*

*I cracked the door open without a sound and slid into the corridor, the security guard leaned up against a wall facing the other direction, towards the elevator. I doubt they expected someone to come from the interior of the floor. I approached him and put a single round into the back of his head. Before he could fall to the ground, I caught him and carried his body back to the maintenance closet. After I stowed his body, I walked to the door of the apartment and slid in. I could hear the target in the living room watching some videos of his last flight. The asshole seemed to think he was the best pilot in the verse based on how he was talking to himself. As I moved in behind him the floor creaked, he flipped around but before he could say anything I put a bullet between his eyes and he dropped to the floor like a sack of potatoes.
*The next part of the mission was to make it look like a robbery as well, the contract requested that I toss the place. So easy enough just break a few things and toss shit around. As I was tossing the place, I saw schematics for a jet like none I had seen before. Next to it was some shiny looking metal. I assume that was one of his current ships he was testing but who cares. I continued tossing the place and made my way back to the maintenance shaft and up to the next floor.*

*After making my way back to the [[Outrider]], I stowed my gear and sent confirmation that the job was complete.*

Good lord that seemed like so long ago. But that makes me wonder how the Syndicate got the material. OR better yet has the Syndicate been around for that long? What if he was working for them? So many questions and this material sitting in front of me was tied to it all.
I sat there contemplating what to do. I didn’t want to broadcast that I had this over [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] channels, but I needed some help figuring out what this could be used for. Then I remembered that [[Ceph]] had mentioned a mechanic on [[Microtech]] by the name of [[Sharroos]], I wonder if she would have any idea what it is and what it could be used for.

I pulled up her dossier and found her contact information. I pulled up my [[MobiGlass]] and typed up a message.

*[[ShaRroos]], My name is [[ArchangelCorps]], I am a [[Wing Commander]] with [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]]. [[Cepheus]] gave me your information, in case I needed some work done. I have a product that I need some information on. Would you mind if I came by your shop and see if you might have some information on it. Also, this is off the record so please do not tell anyone of this message or my coming.*

Now I waited for a response…beep, beep, beep. Damn that was fast.

*I’m a bit busy but I can try to squeeze you in sir*

Good deal, I sent a quick response telling her my ETA. Hopefully I can figure this out before anything else happens.

I walked to the command deck and found my pilot fiddling with his controls.

“Set a course for [[New Babbage]]. Preferably as quickly as possible. “

“Copy that sir. Setting course for [[New Babbage]].”

I turned around and headed back to my office. And pulled up the dossiers on [[ShaRroos]] and Cepheus. I wanted to be sure I had all my details going into this conversation.
