We just got back in [[Arcorp]] following another raid on one of the [[Syndicates]] hideouts. I don't think any of us knew how many bases they had throughout [[Stanton]]. It seems like every time we take one out another one pops up. We are going to have to find their stronghold at some point. 

I received a message from a familiar face today, [[Fives-Fett]]. It has been a long time since I saw that face. First time I saw it was through a scope. 

5 years prior

It was just another bounty this one though took me to [[Lyria]] over in [[Arcorp]]. I wasn’t thrilled to leave my family for that long but the pay was better than I had seen in awhile. I set up a nice little over watch about 2 kilometres out and just watched. As I sat there some other ship came in and this crazy bastard came out trying to raid the place from the front. I don't think he realized there was a second exit from the hideout, which worked out for me to flush my target out. My bounty ran out and as he turned around to fight the other bounty hunter I took my shot. Clean headshot. Shortly after I received a message from him stating he was a bounty hunter working for the guild and wanted to meet. Most of the time I don’t care to meet the others but this kid had balls to raid this place from the front, not to mention he flushed him out for me so I owed him. I respond back and head that direction. We chatted for a bit about the job and decided to split the bounty since we both benefited from it, then I took the body back to the authorities. 

Present Day

I was sitting in my quarters looking at the message again. “Good Day Sir, I heard about your Operations that happened at the [[Orphanage]] and wanted to ask you if you and your Team could use some help with this? I would gladly help you deal with some criminals.”

Finally I sent him a response, “We are always looking to add to the team. Why don’t we meet at [[Area 18]] and we can discuss it?”

I wasn’t lying, if this keeps going we are going to need all the help we can get. I guess I’ll take the [[Emelia]] to [[Area 18]]. Will be good to give the team a little R&R before our next raid.
