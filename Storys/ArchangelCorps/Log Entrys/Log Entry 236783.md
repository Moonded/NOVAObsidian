Part 4 of 4

Well here I am in this desolate system. Now I remember why no one comes here other than pirates…there's nothing here. I was en'route to a LaGrange point that the mysterious contact had sent me. Literally nothing there but dead space. I scanned the area but no pings. Looks like I would have to wait. 

Moments later I saw a flicker of light, I almost missed the damn thing since it was so small. My scanners finally picked it up but it was only a drone. I focused my scanners a bit more on it and tried to figure out its origin but it appeared to be laser linked to multiple others, which would make it impossible for me to trace. Whoever this was is definitely a pro at not being found. Knowing that I probably won't see them in person I opened the cargo bay door and walked back to the now open cargo hold. 

I didn’t bother putting my helmet on, even though the door was open to the vacuum of space it still held it oxygen and gravity. As I stood there one of the drones flew in. I could tell behind that lifeless camera that the person I was here to speak with was controlling it. A holographic image appeared in front of me, it was blurry so you couldn't make out any of the features other than it was a person. It spoke in a robotic voice, “So you’re the person who is asking questions and poking around where you shouldn’t be.”

“Well it's kind of my job to do that. Was hoping to speak to you in person.”

“Depending on how this goes you might. Seeing as I don’t know you, I would prefer to keep my identity a secret for now.”

“Understood.” I reached down to a container and pulled out a piece of the skinny material. “I want to know if you know anything about this?” As I held it up to the drone. 

The line was silent for a few seconds then, “I know what it is, yes. Why do you want to know?”

“Because whatever it is, someone is going to great lengths to retrieve it. To the point they destroyed one of my Commander's best ships and kidnapped him, taking several crates of this with them.”

“I heard about [[Cepheus]], I am sad to hear that his ship was destroyed. Do you know who attacked him?”

“I assume the Syndicate. Now I am giving you information and you have yet to answer my question fully. What is this material?”

“It is a material used in creating plating for a stealth ship. You should already know this, was it not you who killed one of my test pilots?” 

“I am going to overlook the fact that you got access to redacted documents, for now. But yes I killed a pilot who had something like this. Are you saying you designed this?”

“Yes I did. You killing that pilot pissed off the powers that be.”

“Apologies, I was just doing business.”

“Just doing business can cause more harm than not. But that is in the past. You know what the syndicate will do and yet you are pursuing them so hard. Are you not worried about what they will do to your family?”

That struck a nerve, “I appreciate your concern with my family but they are not some feeble women who can’t protect themselves. As to why I am pursuing them so hard, I would think that obvious since you have obviously read my dossier and then some.”

“Yes yes, you are a righteous person trying to rid crime from the world. I have heard the story before.”

“Righteous, no. I am someone who is trying to be better than what I was before. I am a person who wants to help make the system safe, not for everyone else, no, I want to make it safe for my daughter. Call it selfish if you will but I don’t care for other people, just my family.”
“Hmm, no wonder [[Cepheus]] likes you. Not to mention, even though you irritated the hell out of [[ShaRroos]], your tenacity to push when others wouldn't, impressed her.”

At that moment the dark space behind my ship shimmered as another ship appeared. It was a Pisces that had some sort of cloaking on it. It shimmered…just like the material in my hands. “Why don’t you put a helmet on and float over there. She is unarmed so don’t be afraid.. or be afraid, it's your choice.”

I stood there for a minute. I had no idea what I was walking into. One of two things could happen. One, she could be working for the syndicate and this is all a trap; or two, which I really hope is the case, is that she is against the syndicate and will help. As much as the [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] mentality is telling me not to trust her, the fact that she has gone to great lengths to hide her identity has impressed me, I guess I’ll take the a leap of faith…literally. I walked over to a locker and grabbed a spare helmet. Sliding it on I heard the hiss as the helmet began supplying it with oxygen. 

I walked to the edge of the abyss and took the leap floating through zero-g, I made my way to the panel and closed the cargo bay door. When it was closed I pushed myself off and headed to the Pisces. The door opened as I approached but when it opened I saw that the pilot seat was facing me and there was no one there. I stepped inside as gravity took hold. “Take a seat,” I heard in that same robotic voice. “There are coordinates already plugged in.” I sat down and slid forward pulling up the nav system. Sure enough there were coordinates already in place, downside was the trip would use up 75% of the fuel in this bird meaning I would have no way back to my ship. Yet another leap of faith. I sat there for a minute thinking of the options again, weighing the pros and cons. Fuck it we have come this far might as well see this to the end. 

I spool up the quantum drive and everything goes black, all the consoles are blank and the Pisces begins aligning with another location. And then boom we she takes off into quantum. I watch as the tanks dwindle down…75%...50%...25%...20%, the drive starts to slow down and the windows turn opaque to the point I can no longer see out of them. I can feel the ship fall out of quantum and manoeuvring to land. I hear the landing gear groan a little as it settles down, the power turns off and I flip around as the door opens up. Standing just outside the door is a woman gesturing to a seat at a table. I walk out and realize I am inside a Liberator. Who the hell is this chick? 

I made my way to the table and sat down. On the table were two glasses and some sort of beverage between the two. She sat down as well and offered a drink. I reluctantly agreed as she poured the amber liquid into the cups. She leaned back and took a sip. “Well it's a pleasure to meet you, [[ArchangelCorps]], my name is [[Italina]].”

[[Italina]], I have heard that name before but where, maybe [[Cepheus|Ceph]] let it slip at some point. “It's a pleasure to finally meet you in person [[Italina]].” 

“I would like to apologize for not letting you fly the ship yourself, I try to stay undetected as much as possible.”

“I can understand that. I did the same back in the day.”

“Yeah I saw you did some questionable work for an agency. And before you ask, no I am not going to tell you how I have the non-redacted files.”

“Well that sucks, was really hoping to learn that tid-bit as even most of [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] hasn't seen that. Be that as it may, how do you know [[Cepheus|Ceph]]?”

“I have done some work on his ship. Quite a few of the modifications were my handy work so I am rather annoyed to see that ship destroyed.”

“Trust me you aren’t the only one angry to see that ship gone. As for your handy work, it's impressive. And if you don’t end up being my enemy, I might see if you could do some work for me.”
“Maybe that can be arranged, but like you said we will have to wait and see. Now what do you want? I take it you want to know about the stealth tech?” 

“Well that is definitely one question I would like to know. Also I wouldn’t mind knowing if you know anything about [[Cepheus|Ceph]]’s location.”

“Well I am not going to give you all your answers without something in return.”

“I figured as much, what will it take?” 

“We will get to that in a second. I’ll answer your first question about the stealth tech. The material you have is used in the plating on a stealth ship. I created it when I was working for the [[Syndicate]].”

She paused as I stared at her. Idk if it was a slip up or if she was telling the truth. Either way she spoke as if it was past tense. “You ‘worked’ for the [[Syndicate]]?”

“Don’t be so surprised, they have their hands in a lot of cookie jars, and they have ways to convince people to work for them. Like I said though, I worked for them developing stealth tech amongst other things. But when I got the chance to leave I took it. When I left, the lab and base I worked at was destroyed, leaving nothing for the Syndicate to use.”

“Then how do they have that tech now?”

“That's exactly what I am trying to figure out. Which leads me to what I want. I know that you have done a few raids on Syndicate outposts in Stanton. Have you come across anything that would lead you to a shipyard?” 

I finally took a sip of the amber fluid she had poured, scotch, a woman from my own heart. Now my dilemma here, that is classified information, so do I tell her or not. I know if I don’t she won’t give me anything else, but if I do I would be leaking information. I decided on the latter as I needed the information she had. “Well, let me think. I do recall finding a shipping manifest. It contained a lot of parts that would be used to build or repair ships. Not to mention there was another that described heavy machinery being moved.”

“Sounds like a shipyard to me, where was it being shipped to?”

“If I recall correctly it was in the [[Pyro]] System. I believe they mentioned [[Pyro II]]. Which in my opinion would be a decent place to hide a base at, seeing as no one bothers to go to that planet.”

“[[Pyro II]], that does make sense. No one would go to a desolate planet that is bound to fall into its sun. To be honest with you the reason I ask is because I am trying to track down where they are manufacturing my parts. The base was destroyed, so I want to know how they have the specs for my tech.”

“I can understand that. If you decide to follow up on this lead would you mind letting me know if you find something. As you probably know [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] is hunting down the [[Syndicate]]. We want to eradicate them and stop whatever it is they are planning.” 

“I might be able to do that. If your goal really is to eliminate them, I might have something to help you. It's an upgraded scanner that would allow you to see their stealth ships. I can offer only one of them so choose wisely on what ship to put it in.”

“Well anything that will help ensure what happened to [[Cepheus|Ceph]]’s ship doesn't happen again is appreciated.”

“As for your question about Cepheus, last I heard, he is still alive. But I don’t know where he is.”

Well at least he is alive, I know she knows where he is, I can see it in her eyes, but I am not going to push seeing as I am on her turf and playing her game. “Fine, as long as he stays alive and finds his way back to us I won't push. But so help me god if he ends up dead, you’ll be the first one I am after.”

“It's cute that you think you could find me. But know that I have no doubt he will find his way back. [[Cepheus]] has a way of getting himself out of scraps. Now is that all you wanted to know?”

“For now, yes.”
“Well then, I already had the [[Pisces]] refuelled. Feel free to hop in and it will take you back to your ship. And here is that scanner I mentioned, don't bother trying to reverse engineer it, if you try to tamper with it it will self-destruct and fry all the internal components.”

“Appreciate it, I'll try not to tamper with it I guess. Also, I have to admit that remote piloting is pretty sweet.”

[[Italina]] chuckled, “Thanks.” As the door closed behind me she said, “I’ll be in touch,” and with a hiss the door was closed. I took a seat in the pilot chair and again the glass went opaque and it took off. I heard the Quantum drive spool up and next thing you know we are hurtling through the sky. 

As we flew back to my ship I thought about everything we talked about. The fact that Cepheus had been working with someone who says she “used” to work for the [[Syndicate]] was rather concerning. Was she lying to me? Did she still work for them? Hell is [[Cepheus]] even alive? Something about her though makes me want to believe her that she doesn’t work for them and that [[Cepheus|Ceph]] is in good hands. I’ll just have to wait and see. Hopefully this scanner will be put to good use. I’ll let Admiral [[Dolbi]] know when I get back in system and see what ship he wants it in. 

I heard the Quantum drive start to spool down, sounds like we are back. Sure enough as soon as we exited quantum the glass became clear again and there sat the Outrider. The Pisces came to a stop near the rear of the ship and I hopped out. Before I even had the back door open the [[Pisces]] had flown off. Seems like [[Italina]] didn't want me to track it when it left. I stepped inside the ship and let the artificial gravity take hold. After pressing the close button I removed the helmet and stowed it back in the locker. Then I stowed the scanner in the shielded compartment in the [[MSR]]’s cargo hold; I would rather keep that hidden until I get back than get it getting seen by someone. I proceeded back to the cockpit and plotted the course for home. I had a lot to process on the flight back.
