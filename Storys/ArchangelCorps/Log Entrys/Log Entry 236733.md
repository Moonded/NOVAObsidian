Location: [[Area 18]]  

The family left yesterday to head back to [[[Hurston]]], which is good because I am going to go talk to some unsavoury people and I don’t what my family around town for that.  

The other night at the bar myself and some of my fellow marines were talking, and we thought it best we take it upon ourselves to try and get some info from other [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] members in the area or in my case some people I used to know. Command contacted me and told me to meet up with one of the Heathens, a man by the name of [[Cepheus]]. Apparently, he had got some info that implicated Malachite in the Orphanage problem. They wanted my help since I had some dealings with him when I was in the ==REDACTED== unit. What they didn’t know is that he was one of my main smugglers for getting weapons and sometimes myself into less than savoury locations to infiltrate enemy compounds.  

So here I am walking to this cushy apartment building. As I walk in the front door I notice a guy standing to the side, obviously looking like a devilish marine. The man looks like my kind of crazy; I have a feeling we will get along. “You must be [[Cepheus]]. Names [[Mik]], but most just call me [[ArchangelCorps]].”  

“Good to meet you. I was told you might know the guy we are about to talk to.”  

“Yeah, I know him. Been a few years since the last time I was in town so hopefully he isn’t mad about loosing a good customer for so long.”  

“How do you know him?”

“Well, he helped me with moving some “packages” (in air quotes) around. Shy of that I can’t say much about it as its still highly classified. But with the right nudge he should give us the info we are looking for.”  

“Understood.”  

We moved into the elevator and took it up to one of the penthouse suites. Malachite always enjoyed the finer things in life. A lot of that was due to how much it cost to trade with him. The Elevator chimes and the door opens and we are met by two very brutish looking body guards. They take us to the balcony where Malachite is standing. He turns, in a thick Russian-esque voice, “[[Mik]]! It’s good to see you kid. I hadn’t heard from you since that trip to [[Lorville]]. Thought you may have been killed.”  

“Good to see you to [[Malachite]]. As for that trip, I decided to go dark for a while. But I am back in the game now with a different group. That is why I am here. This is [[Cepheus]].”  

[[Cepheus]] looks at me like he wants to know about this trip, but he doesn’t need to know yet. “Good to meet you.”  

[[Malachite]] looks suspicious but shrugs it off, “Any friend of [[Mik]]’s is a friend of mine. So, what can I do for you today? Need another dead drop done? Or do you need to be smuggled in a box again?”  

I chuckle then reply, “Nothing like that this time. Just need some info.”  

“Anything for a good friend! What can I help you with?” [[Malachite]] said heartily.

Cepheus steps forward cautiously and says, “We need information on [[The Orphanage]].”  

[[Malachite]]’s expression shifted dramatically. From nostalgic cheer to grim forbearance.

“Mmm… I might know some things.” He said, much quieter now. He glanced to his [[MobiGlass]], and then to mine. Not oblivious to his not-so-subtle cue, I sent him his usual 50,000 UEC fee. His [[MobiGlass]] chimed, he looked down at it and gave a smile, which very quickly faded once he remembered what he was just paid to talk about.  

He looks up to me, his face now paler than it was before. “What you ask is not a topic I like to speak lightly of. That place is a curse even for someone like me.” If this scares Malachite I am concerned with what they are doing there. “All I know is that they come to the cities and gather children off the streets. They take them to that place and then send them to some training area. Most go willingly with the promise of warm food and a bed to sleep in. Training them for what I don’t know.”  

[[Cepheus]] jumps in, “That’s Bullshit, I have information that says you are involved in that operation. Hll you might even be the director.” I push him back a bit and apologies for the abruptness saying, “Sorry, how about I double our normal fee?” I quickly tap on my [[MobiGlass]] and send another 50K [[UEC]] to him.  

[[Malachite]], doesn’t look phased but smiles, “I can see why you think that but you are sorely mistaken. I do know they have a shipment of kids coming in soon. There is a [[Freelancer]] by the name of The Marauder flying out of the spaceport. They will be on there. Whatever mission you are on [[Mik]], be careful. Good friends are hard to come by these days."

“Thanks for the info [[Malachite]], hopefully I’ll see you again.” We make our way back down the elevator. [[Cepheus]] looks concerned and I know the feeling. [[Cepheus]] looks at me, “I’ll send what we learned to command. We need to get more intel on this ship ASAP. Also, thank you. I think he probably would have just shot me if I went in there alone. Nonetheless actually given me some valuable information.”  

“No worries. [[Malachite]] may be on the wrong side of the law, but he is loyal. Not to mention I have paid him a lot of money over the years. Hopefully with this info command can get this mission underway. If you are free later some of us are going for drink. You seem like you might want one after this…I know I do.”  

“I might have to take you up on that offer. See you later [[Mik]].”  

I chuckled as I walked away with how he said my name, try to sound like the man we just left. [[Malachite]] always did sound odd in these parts with his accent. With the info that we just got; this mission should start getting underway.  

My final thoughts for this log. We need to get someone on board that ship.
