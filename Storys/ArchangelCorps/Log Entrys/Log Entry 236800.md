System: [[Stanton]], [[Area 18]]
Location: [[NOVA HQ]]

Well that was an interesting trip back to [[NOVA HQ|HQ]]. Cepheus finally revealed his face, which was a rather interesting turn to the day. But on the trip back we tried to keep things light as he was about to get an interrogation like no other when we got back. Got him caught up on some of the major things that had happened while he was gone, including the death of one of our admirals. 

My pilot called me as we were about to land so that we could head down to the ramp. As we stood up to leave my office I clapped him on the back and said “Glad to have you back [[Cepheus|Ceph]].” We made our way down to the cargo bays as the [[Emelia]] landed and it surprised [[Cepheus|Ceph]] how gentle we landed for being such a big ship. We then made our way back to [[NOVA HQ|HQ]] where security met us in the lobby to take [[Cepheus|Ceph]] to an interrogation suite, at which point I made my way to the admiral's office and gave him an update face to face. 

The admiral understood my reasoning for doing the pickup myself and told me that I should wait in the lobby as [[Cepheus|Ceph]] would be prohibited from participating in any large operations, including anything to do with [[NineTails]] or the [[Syndicate]], but he was going to be reporting to me. Knowing that I planned on keeping him aboard the Emelia for a little while, he may not be directly involved in TFA operations but no harm in overhearing details, plus he may be able to give me some information on [[Italina]] and take a look into this scanner I have on board. 

I made my way back down to the lobby and sat down on one of the benches, closing my eyes for a minute. I let the darkness behind my eyelids take over and all sounds around me seemed to fade a bit as I reminisced about everything that had happened so far. We had a lot of ups and downs recently, more downs than ups though, hopefully that was going to change soon as new allies continued to appear. 

A few hours or so later I heard those familiar footsteps of [[Cepheus]] coming down the hall and I stood. “How’d it go?”

“Well not as bad as I thought, sounds like they are grounding me from TFA for a bit and told me to report to you for my orders.”

“That would be correct. And my first order is for you to grab a hot meal as we discuss what you will be doing.”

“Well I won't say no to some good food.”

We headed out of the building and down to the main shopping area of [[Area 18]]. Lately I have been hitting this hole in the wall street vendor who makes some stellar food. We sat down at the table next to the vendor and he caught me up on what happened in the interrogation.
“Well I am glad they didn’t eat you alive in there. But now that you are cleared, although not for TFA yet, let's talk about what is on your agenda. I have met your friend [[Italina]].”

“I don’t know if I’d call her a friend… More an acquaintance… but, how's she doing?”

“She’s doing well enough, keeping out of sight and working with someone called [[Angel]].”

“[[Angel]]? Sort of scary looking merc guy? Gives off…’me’… vibes??”

“Yeah, helped me deal with some [[Syndicate]] guys out by [[Microtech]] a while back, the battle where we lost the [[admiral]].”

“Yeah, again sorry to hear that. What was your read on him?”

“Well as long as they don’t betray us, I think they will make good allies. She gave me a scanner to help find those stealth ships.”

“That would have been handy before the Point of No Return.”

“Probably but that is a moot point. What I want you to do though is to take a look at it and see if you can replicate it. I know you are good with your toys, maybe you can figure hers out as well. This would keep you on board the Emelia for a little while and we would keep your squadron around as well.”

“Which would keep me in the loop with TFA.”

“My thoughts exactly. It's a matter of time before they fully clear you and I don't want to waste my time catching you up on everything.”

“I'd rather not waste time either. So when do we leave?”

“We’ll be here for a few more days. [[Wing Commander]] duties keep me around here for a little longer and then we will be off again. Family coming in later today, why don't you call your girl and we can all have a nice dinner together.”

“I still haven’t got a chance to talk with [[Cass]] at length… We have a lot of catching up to do… She’s over on Orison and I doubt she can make it here easily… But I’ll certainly be there. In the meantime though, I'm gonna stop by my corporate apartment here, take a nice long, hot shower, make some phone calls, and then I think I’mma cancel my lease here…””

“I think that is well deserved after what you have been through.” We shot the shit for a little longer as we finished eating and then went our separate ways. I headed back to [[NOVA HQ|HQ]] as I had some planning to do for the [[Wing]]. Trying to get four squadrons together for a joint training took some time to prepare.
