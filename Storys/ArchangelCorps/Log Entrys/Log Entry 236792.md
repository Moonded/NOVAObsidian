N-ID: 643856 - [[Wing Commander]]
Callsign: [[ArchangelCorps]]
System: [[Stanton]], [[MicroTech]]
Location: [[NSS Emelia]] 

I watched from outside the airlock as [[Angel]]’s [[Pisces]] landed on the top of the [[NSS Emelia]]. The ramp opened up and the same mercenary from the ground walkout wearing his [[Artimax armor]]. He made his way into the airlock and the doors hissed as it pressurized and opened. 

“Welcome aboard the [[Emelia]] Angel.”

“Thanks, she's a good looking ship.”

We make our way back to the elevator and head to the habitation deck. “She’s definitely a nice place to call home when not planet side.”

The elevator doors opened and we walked down the corridors to my office. As the doors shut I said, “Feel free to have a seat. Scotch?”

As he took a seat he responded, “Thank you, maybe next time.”

“I understand.” I went ahead and poured myself a glass, placing the topper back on the bottle. I swirled the glass, took a sip and then took a seat at my chair. “Hope you don’t mind me having a glass, always helps cool the nerves after a fight like that.”

“Your house, your rules.”

“True, when I am at home I do the same. Now let’s chat.” I clicked a few buttons on my desk. “I had the room fitted with some tech to deter any prying eyes. It's good for these meetings when you don't want it recorded.”

The light in his visor flickers for a second, almost as though he grinned at the thought of me attempting to record. “So what would you like to chat about?”

“Well first off, you said you had a personal investment in seeing the [[Syndicate]] brought down. What kind of ‘personal investment’ are you talking?” 

“Let’s just say me and my friends have had some dealings with them that left a bad taste in our mouths. Why is [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] starting a war with them?”

“Well, let’s just say a friend of ours has some ‘dealings’ with them as well that we would like to see dealt with.”

“You mean what happened at [[The Orphanage]] and with Malachite?”
“Alright let’s cut the crap, doesn’t seem like either one of us wants to be fully honest with the other. So how bout we start over, from the top. Obviously you know enough about [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]]’s involvement with the [[Syndicate]]. We had a tip about them doing some illegal activities involving kids near our [[NOVA HQ|HQ]], which led to the battle at the [[Orphanage]]. After that we pursued some leads and captured [[Malachite]], a known member of the [[Syndicate]]. Also we obviously have a mole within [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] that has been leaking information and helping the [[Syndicate]] over the last several months. I am one of the leaders of a Task Force that is dedicated to tracking down the [[Syndicate]] and removing them from the game.”

He sat there taking it all in and then spoke “Yeah I have heard most of that shy of the mole. I will say I am sorry to hear about that but not surprised.” 

“Thanks. Now you. Who are you and why are you against them?”

“Well I can’t give you everything, but a friends of mine  had some run-ins with the Syndicate. I have been helping them run down leads and attempt to obtain intel and materials that would be useful.”

“Would this ‘colleague’ by chance be a woman named [[Italina]]?”

His visor flickered again, and this time with a slight color change. The change was subtle enough most people wouldn’t notice but after time with Cepheus I had gotten used to reading that visor really easily. “I’m sorry, who?.”

“Interesting, so your scanning tech wasn’t created by her? Only reason I ask is because it would take a very special engineer to create a scanner that can read the faintest of readings of a person walking into an AO like you did. But alas if you don’t know her I guess I will stand corrected.”

“I guess so, '' he said and continued to sit there stoically. 

“Well we have a common enemy, the only issue is I don’t know what your intentions are.”

“My intentions are easy, I want to see them destroyed.”

“Well that's easy enough to work with. What's that old saying, ‘The enemy of my enemy is my friend.’ Seeing as we are both wanting them gone I propose we work together. You seem to be privy to knowledge that others don't, and I have the backing of [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]]. With your intel and my teams, I think we could make quick work of the Syndicate, or at least quicker.”

He sat there for a few minutes, by that cold stare from the visor I assumed he was weighing some options. “I could possibly agree upon that, but I need you to understand that I won’t be working for you. I am not one of your soldiers.”

“Never expected you to be. Personally, I am looking for allies. This fight is bigger than just [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] vs. [[Syndicate]]. The more eyes and manpower we have working with us, the better the outcome will be for everyone affected by the Syndicates claws.”
“Agreed. Now if you don't mind, it's been a long day and I got some errands to take care of,” he said as he stood. 

I clicked a couple buttons on my desk to turn off the dampeners and stood up. “I understand, I appreciate you meeting with me nonetheless.” We walked out of the office and back down towards the elevator. As we walked to the airlock I said, “I assume you already know how to contact me, so if you hear anything please let me know.”

“I will. Appreciate you letting me take out some [[Syndicate]] guys today.” 

“You are always welcome to railgun enemies for me,” I said with a nod as the airlock shut and hissed to the vacuum of space. 

After watching his Pisces take off I headed back to my office. I had a message that needed to be sent to [[NOVA HQ|HQ]], and frankly I was not looking forward to it. As I walked down the hall my second-in-command walked up. “Everything has been stowed sir and the Admirals body is in the med bay.”

“Thank you. Have our pilot set a course for [[Area 18]], we have a lot to do.”

“Yes sir,” he said and walked off towards the bridge. 

I sat down at my desk, took another sip from my scotch and pulled up my [[MobiGlass]]. I needed to inform [[Admiral]] [[Dolbi]] of the news. With my mobi pulled up I began typing:

*Admiral,*

*I regret to inform you that the mission was a failure. The [[Syndicate]] had no intention of releasing our admiral unharmed. They executed him on site. We have eliminated the enemy force and retrieved his body. We are inbound to [[Area 18]] with it in tow. *

*Even though the mission was a failure we did gain another ally in this fight. A mercenary that was on site hunting the Syndicate has agreed to assist with intel and future missions. *

*I will have a full report for you about both the above topics upon my arrival.*

*-[[ArchangelCorps]]*

I sat back looking at the message and took another sip. It's been a long time since I failed a mission like this. It was bound to happen at some point when fighting against a terrorist group like the syndicate. With this mission over with though, I have to figure out where the hell [[Cepheus]] is and where our next target will be. I took another sip and hit send. 

As it went through I felt the quantum drive begin to spool up. Once we drop off the body and I have my debrief, we are going to set out again though. I will not let the syndicate rest, the [[Ghosts]] and I will continue our hunt and keep taking down [[Syndicate]] cells throughout [[Stanton]].
