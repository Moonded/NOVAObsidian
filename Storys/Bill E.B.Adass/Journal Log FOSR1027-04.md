Well, this has all gone down hill pretty fast. The [[Administrator]] at [[Bajini Point]] did not simmer down as I had hoped.

He let me stew in that holding cell for a couple of days. He even sent a few security guys in to take my [[MobiGlass]]. Now that was downright mean and also unheard of. No one is ever separated from those gadgets.

I raised a little hell over that and he finally relented and returned it.

Sarah and the brothers were cut loose and confined to quarters. Only being allowed out for station maintenance work parties and meals. So, [[Fearless]]’ status has been put on hold.

My status as a decorated CDF veteran didn't hold water with the [[Administrator]]. Seems he is also a vet and holds himself to higher standards.

As he passed sentence on my case, he stated," The people of [[Stanton]] as a whole should be able to look to our veterans as examples of honour and lawfulness". His voice rang across the room clear as a bell and he continued," Sir, the way you have conducted yourself on my station has been neither".

The words struck me as a little unfair, but accurate enough. Knowing myself I will spend quite a lot of time analyzing them.

He then sentenced me to be immediately transferred to Klescher. With a charge of CS-2 it should be a fairly brief stay. I’ll just mine a few rocks and be released in a week or less.

After the initial 48hr lockdown period, what is also known as suicide watch, I enrolled in the work program and headed out to the mines. I didn’t expect any trouble while here as I am a former resident. Wasn’t my first time here for sure. I have been known to dust it up from time to time.

On my way to the mines I actually heard my name called out a few times in greeting and gave a nod in their direction in acknowledgement.

I also saw a few frowns from others who recognized me, but I knew they wouldn’t be any trouble, this time.

I had made myself known as a man who can and will handle any trouble on past stays here. Even the lifers who had nothing really to lose gave nods of respect as I passed.

I chuckled to myself thinking of my last stay here as I continued on to the mines.

I collected my multi tool and OreBit from the dispensary and filled my oxygen reserve. I walked on into the mines.

On my walk I decided to give Sarah a buzz and see how she and the brothers were getting on. She said they were fine. Maybe a bit ticked at the way they had been treated, but fine anyway.

She expressed condolences for my sentence and asked if I had any news about [[the Orphanage]] and the kids. I let her know that I hadn’t heard anything new and I reassured her that a little time in this place was no big deal. We ended the comm with tentative plans to meet when it became possible.

Now that is something I am looking forward to. Sarah is that kind of person. The kind you want to keep in your life.

I spent many long hours mining and thinking about the kids. The more I thought about all of these kids that had been made parentless by the [XenoThreat] that had devastated so much of the Stanton system, the more frustrated I became with this set back. I was growing more and more anxious and I would just really like to get on with it, but I am stuck here.

I am stuck here mining.

Well, I just will have to make the best of it I suppose.

I had a backpack full of lousy rocks as the pickings had been slim in the mines and went to process them.

I thought even though they were low calibur rocks, I would still get a significant reduction in time.

Boy was I wrong. I mean they would have, but the processing station was glitched and I couldn’t make a deposit. Klecher has no one to complain to.

Sure there are a few guards around, but they are under strict orders not to communicate with prisoners. They are only there to maintain order and don’t give a crap about any prisoners' frustrations.

I was beyond annoyed at this point and well into the stage of obstinate frustration. I had started thinking about other avenues to get out of here. It also wouldn’t be the first time I’ve sought an alternative route from this place.

So, I decided to shoot my buddy Sledge a message.

  

-- Begin Message --   

Sledge, I’m at KRF and I think I need an Uber. Can you accommodate?  

-- End Message --

  

Now that message is cryptic and refers to an old Earth system of transportation, but Sledge will understand what I mean. It’s not like I could just outright ask him to help me escape when all my message traffic will be analyzed by the facilities AI.

Well, time to go get prepared for a break to the surface.
