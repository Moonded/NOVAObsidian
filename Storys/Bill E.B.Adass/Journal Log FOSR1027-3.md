I've had too much time on my hands while hanging around here waiting on the yard dogs to get [[NSS Fearless|Fearless]] back operational. I spent a day cleaning and scrubbing the interior and even went as far as touching up paint. It was a lot of work, but she is looking shipshape. Like she just came off the line.  

I was doing all this to take my mind off of the kids. I figured staying busy with my hands would stop the nagging questions in my mind and the scenarios my overactive imagination kept coming with at bay.

To some extent it did, but it wasn't enough. I'm still having trouble sleeping and being tired makes me a bit grumpy and hard to get along with.  

I screwed up though.  

I thought making friends with some of the crew working on my navigation computer would be a great idea.  

I thought this would serve two purposes, but just exasperated the situation really.

Some of the yard dogs working on Fearless were pretty friendly, [[Bob]],[[Tom]] and the lovely [[Sarah]] especially so.

These three were working on dismantling the nav putter on the interior and while I was working on scrubbing the deck and and other stuff.

We shot the shit and had some rather robust talks.

[[Bob]] and [[Tom]] were brothers and had immigrated from [[Lorville]] on [[Hurston]].

[[Bob]] did most of the talking for the pair and by the end of their first shift on my ship I had heard most of their life story.

It seems neither of them cared for mining and smelting, so they signed on as apprentices for ship building with a local union.

When they had completed the apprenticeship, the opportunity to get off planet brought them to [[ArcCorp]] and [[Bajini Point]] to work in maintenance and repair.

I liked them both right off the bat.  

Bob said whatever came to mind and [[Tom]] was quiet and thoughtful. When Tom spoke, he said few words and got straight to the point.  

Now the lovely Sarah and yes I will probably preface her name each time just as I think of her.

It's not really about her looks, she was pretty enough no doubt, but once she let down her guard a bit. She just blossomed like a lovely flower.

Turns out Sarah had a similar story. She didn't like the cold of [[MicoTech]] and followed the same path of apprenticeship and job placement with the union. 

The three liked the overcrowded planet of [[ArcCorp]] and the hustle and bustle.  

They told me many tales of excursions all over the planet.  

Turns out they like to race [[Apua Nox]] and [[Drake Dragonflies]] around the streets is [[ArcCorp]].

Apparently there are a metric ton of "race clubs" all over the [[Stanton]] system. These clubs are not sanctioned and every meet is illegal on the streets of [[ArcCorp]], but they still happen.  

Often.

This is where things get a little frustrating for me in regards to my need to know what's going on at the Orphanage.  

After that first shift ended, I thought it would be a good idea to ask these three if I could buy them a drink.  

All three responded with some version of " Hell Yeah" and smiles.  

I have to admit I walked to the rear of the group just to see the wiggle in the walk of Sarah.  

We found an open table and everyone sat , but me.

I headed to the bar and ordered the first round of drinks and opened a tab for our group.  

The bartender seemed to know the others and said, " Don't y'all start any trouble in here".  

I said to him," No need to worry about that. We just need to wash away a bit of hard work" and he put the pitcher of beer and four glasses on the bar roughly, spilling a little beer.

He grunted and said, "I said what I said".  

I grabbed the steins by the handles in one hand and the pitcher in the other and turned to my companions who were snickering at the table.  

I crossed to them, put the glasses down and poured beer for each of us. Then I took a seat.  

The three of them were still smiling and I asked," What the heck was that about"?  

Bob, as the talker, answered for the group, "Aww, don't worry about Liam, he's just still grumpy about the other night. You see, we like to give fly boys a hard time in here every once in a while".  

"Fly boys", I asked with raised brows and a grin.  

" Some of you pilots come in here and we are pretty sure you've spent too much time out in the black. All high falutin' and looking down on us yard dogs" Bob said with a grin and continued" We have had some lively conversation in here that may have ended a time or two with bruised egos, broken glasses and maybe a bloody nose, but nothing too serious".

"Anyway, ol' [[Liam]] over there gets a kick out of it himself, but doesn't want security in here or worse a lecture from someone over in [[Admin]]. So, he warns you fly boys when you come in", he said with a little laugh.  

I looked over at the bartender and shrugged and turned back to the table.  

We swapped stories back and forth, played some tunes on the jukebox and was having a pretty good time when the lovely Sarah turned to me and asked, "So, fly boy," looking at me with those grey eyes like storm clouds, "do you wanna have some fun"?  

I have to say my mind went straight to thoughts that had nothing to do with what she was asking and apparently it showed all over my face, because the three of them started guffawing with laughter.  

I looked around the table with a look of dumbfoundedness that made them laugh harder, almost to the point of tears.  

Finally Sarah got a grip on her laughter asked if I wanted to go for a ride on a Dragonfly with them and this is where things went a little awry.  

Tom spoke up," I think we've talked about the plight of the economy and the decimation caused by [[Xeno]]'s quite enough for one evening. Let's go have a little fun".  

Sarah said," Go grab your EVA gear and meet us at Hanger 8 and be ready for some real fun, fly boy"!  

We got up and headed for the exit and I looked back over my shoulder to see the bartender, Liam, watching us leave.  

I wouldn't exactly call it a smile, but it was a close approximation I suppose, on his face. I suppose he was relieved we were leaving without any trouble this time.  

I gave him a slight nod and the old bastard frowned and gave me the finger.  

I just turned away thinking what a grumpy ass he is. It made me smile anyway and I went to grab my gear and meet the" The Terrors of [[Bajini Point]]", that's what they called their race club and I was to find out how apt a name it was very soon.  

The three were already suited up and were getting their [[Dragonflies]] ready to launch.

[[Bob]] said with a little laugh," Fly boy, you ride with [[Sarah]], she's the lightest, Tom and I may actually be able to keep up with her this time".  

[[Sarah]] said with a chuckle," Yeah right". And punched [[Bob]] on the shoulder, " That'll be the day".  

Just before sealing our helmets and climbing in the [[Dragonflies]], [[Tom]] handed each of us a detox pen which we administered to ourselves.  

I immediately felt clear headed as the drug went instantly to work on the alcohol in my system.  

Tom then looked at me and said," We may be crazy, but we are not stupid", and smiled at me.  

I was impressed by the forethought of this bunch and it eased my apprehension just a bit.  

Bob called up ATC through his Mobi and gave them some BS about a test flight and they finally opened the door after some more back and forth between them.  

As soon as the hanger door was opened enough to fit a Dragonfly the three shot through without an inch to spare.

Sarah and I were leading the pack and we came to a sudden stop at the edge of the hanger deck where the other two pulled alongside us.  

The three had a brief, fast conversation that I didn't understand a word of and then we took off like we had been shot out of the barrel of a laser cannon!  

It's hard to describe what that ride was like from the rear facing passenger seat of a [[Dragonfly]], but it was exciting. And I was holding on for dear life!  

We went up, down and around every part of the station. I had no idea there were so many nooks and crannies those fast and nimble machines could fit into.  

I have a whole new perspective of the space stations around the [[Stanton]] system now.

When the trio decided flying in, out and around every antenna, cargo container and whatnot for half an hour or so, had gotten boring and without consulting me and lots of devious chuckling the next thing I knew we were buzzing incoming and outgoing ships.  

We flew between landing gear and pads as ships were on final approach.  

We zipped over ships from aft to forward as they lifted off the pad. I could see the pilot's faces of dismay and in some cases rage from my position behind Sarah.  

That's when the comms started going nuts, pilots were raising hell with ATC about the psychos flying around scaring the hell out of them.  

ATC started asking questions and put two and two together.  

They began calling [[Bob]], [[Tom]] and [[Sarah]] by name and telling them to cut it out and get back inside.  

Obviously this wasn't the first time these three had done this since ATC were so quick to reach the correct conclusion on the culprits.  

The trio were laughing their heads off and continued flying around the station until ATC threatened to sic security on them. 

That ended our escapade and we headed back towards the hanger.  

I was pretty sure I would need a crowbar to get the seat out of my asscrack and someone might just have to use some other tool to get my hands unlocked from their death grip on the handles.  

I was sure of one thing though, I knew I would be doing this again. The next time I would have to be facing forward and have the controls in my own hands.  

The adrenaline rush was addictive and I was hooked!

We got in the hanger and shut down the machines.

Bob was talking to someone named Phil in ATC who gave an audible sigh of relief that could be heard over the comms when [[Bob]] informed him we were inside the hanger and the door began to close.  

We were all hooting, hollering and giving each other high fives as we started getting out of our gear in the pressurized hanger.  

I looked around the group and said with a big grin on my face," I need a drink after all that"!  

With nods of agreement all around we headed for the elevator and made our way back to the bar.  

There was a sense of comradery amongst our little band of miscreants. It's a feeling induced by shared, intense experiences like we had just done.  

I was sure I had just made friends for life. That thought pleased me immensely and added to the smile in my face.  

As we walked back in I looked at Liam behind the bar and noticed his grimace of displeasure upon seeing us.

I shrugged it off and headed straight to him, squeezing between customers at the bar and ordered another pitcher of beer and four shots of whiskey.  

Liam just grunted, which seems to be his go to sound, and began filling a pitcher at the tap and put shot glasses on the bar that he poured whiskey in while the pitcher filled.  

Whatever else he may be, a great bartender he was.  

He put everything on a tray, including beer mugs and slid it in my direction.  

I grabbed the tray and went to my companions.  

I sat the tray on the table and poured each of us a mug of beer.

Everyone stood around the little table and we then grabbed a shot each and held them up in front of us.  

I said, "Salud!" And we each slammed our shot, put the shot glasses down and picked up the beer mugs and took a long swallow.  

We sat down and began a lively discussion about the events of the evening.

We were laughing and talking about all the barrel rolls, dips and dives.  

I was laughing about these things now, but while it was happening I thought I was going to die.  

The conversation moved to the part that included buzzing the ships.  

As they were laughing about the looks on some of the pilot's faces in their cockpits.  

How tight the fit was between the pad and the belly of the Andromada we squeezed under and the loop we made around the nose of a Hercules.  

That's when I felt a hard tap on my shoulder.  

A voice accompanied that tap with, " Hey buddy".  

I turned to look up at the speaker and saw five or six others standing loosely spread out behind this tall red faced pilot.  

I began to rise , turn and slide my chair out of the way.  

I could tell by the looks in their faces and the tenseness of their bodies that they were here for blood.

Only blood would appease them.  

I could sense my new friends getting up from their chairs and though we had just met I knew I could count on them.

Just then Liam yells from behind the bar," NO TROUBLE, I don't want no trouble in here!"  

Based on our initial conversation I knew he was speaking to me, but I didn't take my eyes off the spokesman of this group of pissed off pilots.  

He was red faced and angry and had bolstered his courage with alcohol and definitely spoiling for a fight.  

I suppose hearing us regale each other with highlights of our trip outside the station had got their blood boiling, but we hadn't meant any harm and no one had been hurt or in any true danger except ourselves.  

A Dragonfly would just bounce right off the shield of any ship we buzzed.  

I could see that anything I or anyone else said wasn't going to mean anything to this group.

Nothing would do, but to settle it with fisticuffs.  

Well, I was taught that the best defense was a good offense and I put all my weight into the right jab to his nose. Hmm, maybe I have that backwards, oh well.  

I followed into the punch with a tackle that sent me and "red face" crashing into the pilots standing behind him.  

This had the effect of pushing them back and scattering them kind of like bowling pins.  

This gave my companions the opportunity to get clear of the table and into the fray.  

Sarah came out swinging her chair and that little equalizer let her smash two of the other pilots in the head and they were out.

They backed away, one holding a bleeding, split ear, the other a throbbing cheek that was already turning purple.  

Bob and Tom were actually giggling as they each grabbed a pilot in a headlock, punched them in the face a few times and then rammed into one another causing the pilots to headbutt one another.  

It was almost comical the way the guys just sat down, dazed and confused, holding their heads in their hands.  

The brothers did a fist bump then turned to the last guy who just held up his hands and took a few steps backward before turning and headed to the exit with a not quite run.

I was kneeling on the red faced pilot's chest and I looked down and saw he was actually unconscious and realized that just like that, this whole thing was over.  

It had to be less than thirty seconds, maybe forty-five.

I suppose that's how life is though.  

Things just happen so fast sometimes.  

Liam was faster though.  

Apparently he had a little red emergency button that summoned security and it only took him a second to push it.  

That's why I am writing all this while sitting in a holding cell at [[Bajini Point]].  

The station [[Administrator]] was apoplectic as the security team hauled us in and he screamed at us for an hour before putting us in the cells.  

He has no idea what to do with us. I'm a decorated CDF veteran and a member of NOVA and the other three are the best of his yard dogs.  

I have to notify [[Commander]] [[Hunwyn]] and he'll have to brief [[High Command]].  

I'm sure [[Admiral]] [[Dobi]] will not be pleased.  

Well, I suppose I better get on with it.  

The worst part personally is that I will be delayed meeting with Sledge. The mystery surrounding these kids is never far from my thoughts.

I better let Sledge know as well. I hope he doesn't go in alone.  

I was glancing through some open [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] message traffic and saw that [[Cepheus]] and [[TheRealChappie]] are now involved in finding out what's going on at [[the Orphanage]].  

I'm sure Sledge has seen the same traffic. Hopefully they'll get together for this investigation.
