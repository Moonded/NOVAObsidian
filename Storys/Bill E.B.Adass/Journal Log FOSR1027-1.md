I've recently heard some scuttlebutt that's trickled down from High Command about a place called The Orphanage and I overheard a conversation in the bar at [[Bajini Point]] about all the kids who lost their families during [[Xeno Threat]]. The conversation I overheard was about these kids and how they were being taken to a place on [[Lyria]] called "[[The Orphanage]]".While preparing for an upcoming Op, I noticed some worrisome things while in [[Area 18]], [[ArcCorp (planet)|ArcCorp]] . As I made my way through the Zones, it occurred to me that I was seeing a lot of children hanging around in little groups. It seemed they were all shabbily dressed and quite dirty.

I got a little hungry  and grabbed a hot dog and a Fizz from a vendor. I sat on a bench, removed my helmet to lower the volume of my growling stomach and irrigate my parched throat. While I was sitting I watched a group of ragamuffin kids nearby. Something was just a little off.

My Op took me to [[Lyria]]. Upon arrival at [[Lyria]] I had to replot the course to my destination and while looking at the Starmap I noticed the location for " The Orphanage" and that's when I began making some connections, because those kids were in the back of my mind since seeing them at [[Area 18]].

Now because of Op time-frames and the pressing need to get the training right, I put the thoughts on the back burner.

I write this after completing the Op and tossing and turning in my rack all night. I'm going to head to [[Lyria]] and this place called The Orphanage and see what I can see. I'll be flying my MSR- [[NSS Fearless]]. I'll let my Commander know what I've found ASAP.
