Squadron: FAR OUT
N-ID: 2540216 – [[Core Engineer]]/[[Pilot]] [[NPL-03]]

Ship: [[NSS Fearless]]
Name: [[Bill E.B.Adass]]
Callsign: [[scardfaice]]

I’ve been stuck here at [[Bajini Point]] while [[NSS Fearless|Fearless]] is being worked on. Damned quantum drive failure. Oh, the QD spools up just fine, but the computer that controls calibration is fragged. The yard dogs tell me they have a replacement, but to get to it they will have to remove some plating and come in from the outside of the hull. It’s going to take time and they aren’t sure how long.

In my last log I said I was headed to [[Lyria]] to check out [[the Orphanage]]. Well that was a fiasco and very frustrating. I was very determined to get out there as quickly as possible and jumped in Fearless and got her flight ready. I plotted the course to [[Lyria]] and requested clearance from [[Bajini Point Flight Control]]. After being cleared I lifted off from the pad and raised the landing gear. I then oriented to the [[Lyria]] QT marker and initiated the jump. All seemed to go just as it should and I entered Quantum.

I decided to hop out of the seat and head back to the kitchen for some refreshment. I felt like a snack and a cup of hot cocoa would do me good since I had skipped breakfast. I pulled up my Mobi to check the course and low and behold [[NSS Fearless|Fearless]] was way off course and headed into the black. I jumped up, spilling cocoa everywhere and ran to the cockpit. I stopped the quantum drive and started running diagnostics on the ship's systems. I found the calibration computer was unable to lock onto anything at this point. I determined using old fashioned star charts that I was several hundred thousand KM of course. I plotted a course back to [[Bajini Point]] and after a couple days using Hydrogen drive I made it back to port.

As I was arriving I received a message from my squamate Sledge. It was a relief to hear I am not the only one concerned about these kiddos and I hope he leans on that lowlife extra hard and gets all the information he can out of him. Anything will be useful, but I hope the guy has some real answers and not just more rumours.
I just shot a response to Sledge.
Message reads:

```
Sup bud? Are you recovering from the system market crash? Count me in! Got some ship issues, but should be resolved soon and I’ll meet you in a few days.

Over and Out,
~Bill
