A deep sigh broke the silence in the cockpit, jolting Steve from his daydream - watching the stars pass was always hypnotising.  

"Don't you think this is a little bit excessive?" questioned a rather bored sounding voice from below his feet,  

"Not at all." [[Steve]] replied, jovially "In fact if you'd bothered to look at the briefing you'd see this was the only vessel capable of carrying the number of reported casualties. Besides, couldn't you have brought this up before we were half an hour into our quantum jump?"  

Another sigh, this one more frustrated than the first "I just mean I'm not sure I feel entirely safe flying a ship worth more than every recorded member of my family into a possibly hostile area. Better yet abandoning it while we go hunting for ghosts!"  

"Well, it's a good thing it's my insurance policy then, isn't it? I'm sure if something goes horribly wrong our rescuers will be flying something more sensible. Perhaps you'd prefer a cutlass? Just make sure you bring the tape to hold the engines on."  

An audible groan of disgust is next to fill the quiet "You know fine well I didn't-" the pilot trails off before piping up "Oh! We're here! Disengaging quantum travel in three... Two... One."  

Just as quickly as the stars were passing, they jolt to a stop along with the ship and the once blurred and out of focus moon of [[Calliope]] fills the canopy of the [[Carrack]].  

"I'm off to suit up, Jake. You've got the coordinates to put us down. Don't worry, lad, it'll all be finished before you know it and you can get back to your paperwork."  

With an abrupt click, the log completes.
