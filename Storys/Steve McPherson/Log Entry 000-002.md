The hiss of a suit pressurising comes over the line as the next log begins, followed by the sound of a rifle bolt being racked three times, then the insertion of a magazine and one final pull of the charging handle. A loud clunk signals the rifle being put down, before the sound of a seat swivelling into position along with the flicking of switches and start up sequence of a small craft.  

A computerised voice is the first to speak on this log, only faintly audible through the suit - an [[Anvil]] ship, but that's all that can be made out before the more commanding voice of Steve breaks through.

"Jake, open hangar doors. Stay close by just in case - not sure how bad it's gonna be down there and if it goes sideways I could use those turrets."

"Affirm, [[Captain]]. I'll keep a twenty-klick orbit, at FL three-zero-zero. You know, that only matters if you don't lose connection as soon as you step inside. Or if you even see them coming for that matter!" Jake protests over the commlink, but the sound of a flicked switch and the steady groan of the hangar doors opening says he knows it won't make a difference  

"You know me by now - nothing catches me off guard." Steve retorts with more than a little bit of sarcasm as his engines spool up "But you're right - I'll maintain contact once I'm on the ground. If I go dark for more than twenty minutes, you can feel free to come rescue me for a change. [[Lifeguard One]] away, happy sailing."

[[Jake]] attempts to stutter out a response, but doesn't manage to put a sentence together in the appropriate time, only responding rather defeatedly "Affirm, Lifeguard One. Fly safe."

The journey down to the moons surface is uneventful - [[Steve]] hums a tune to fill the silence, buttons are pressed and switches are flipped, but eventually his voice breaks the quiet again "[[Lifeguard One]] approaching wreck site. Still signs of burning, so we're here fast - I guess we'll see just how fast. Touchdown in ten."

There's no response from the ship in orbit, but that's not altogether unexpected at this stage - Jake will be thinking of his own witty reply for later when something goes wrong, like a stubbed toe or a cracked visor. No matter - the sound of landing gear deploying is rapidly followed by the juddering sound of the craft setting down, then the depressurisation of the cabin as the ramp opens.  

The rifle is picked up once more and checked once more for good measure, then the undeniable click of a helmet mounted light is enabled.

"[[Lifeguard One]] on deck, beginning the search for survivors at the aft of the wreckage."

Heavy breathing and just as heavy footsteps are all but masked by the sound of roaring wind and small particles battering against the visor of his helmet right up until they suddenly stop, an occasion just as marked by the transition from heavy steps on rock to a single step on metal.  

"Alright and this one's for the official log - Constellation class vessel, Taurus reported but it's impossible to tell with this level of damage. The aft of the ship is mostly intact above the cargo bay, but it looks like they slid for a few hundred metres before they came to a total stop. Cargo bay is clear - moving onto the crew quarters."

With a few fumbling noises alongside the heavy steps on the catwalks, there's a slight hissing sound followed by the ignition of an [[OxyTorch]].

"Door is inaccessible, going to have to cut through - doesn't bode too well for anyone inside, I guess, but it is what it is. Gonna complete the sweep but I've gotta tell you, Jake, I wouldn't get your hopes up about having any miracle cases you can write on your CV after this one."

As soon as the talking stops, so does the hissing as the door is released - the creaking of metal along with Steve's grunting mark it being opened.

"Alright - crew quarters. Ah, shit." he remarks in frustration before trailing off into a few moments of silence "Three dead, by the looks of it. At least if I'm counting the arms and legs around here right. I'm gonna continue on to the-"  

A few quiet knocks followed by a louder bang ring through the otherwise silent ship, and the sound of the rifle being shouldered briefly cut out the audio of the recording.

"-rescue team, show yourself or you will be assumed hostile and attempting to impede my investigation!" are all that's heard being shouted - the replies aren't heard with any clarity, but they're clearly shouted back in desperation, not in anger.

The log goes silent for a few moments - entirely silent, the audio cut off entirely before it returns with a crackle of static.

"Scratch that. We've got one alive - the co-pilot, a Mr... Hold on, what was your name again? You've gotta slow down and start talking sense."

The other voice rings out over the microphone, still yelling "Jesus Christ, I told you already, it's Maier! Lorenz Maier! Put the gun down, please! Take whatever you want, just let me go!"

An equally loud "Whoa there!" matches the volume of Maier's shouting "Do I look like a pirate to you? What, you thought I shot you down in a Pisces and came here loaded with medical supplies to, what, drug you to death? Sit down and shut up, man, I've got work to do here. Better yet, suit yourself up as best you can and take this to see you through until we get up top."

The quiet jingling of glass vials precedes the continued protests of Maier, though they're less enthusiastic "What even is this?! You might be here to drug me to death, how am I supposed to know?!"  

A deep, frustrated sigh fills the microphone with a second of static before a few loud footsteps head back over towards the injured man "What, your eyes all fucked up too? Look - Rox-Ah-Phen. Roxaphen. It's branded, it's got the little [[CureLife]] hologram logo on it, what else do you want me to do? Either take the stim or I'll take it back, makes no difference to me - but it's gonna make getting out of here suck a whole lot more if you don't, I promise you that. Now if you'll excuse me - I've got a cockpit to secure."

More protests are cut off with a quick "Aaaaahbapbap!" before the log continues on with the sound of another door creaking open "Pilot dead, turret operator presumed dead seeing as his turret is about three hundred feet behind us in the debris." then, with an increase in volume "Happy now, Maier? You get to go home!"

A moment of silence and then another call of "Hey, Maier? You back there?"

A few more footsteps until he reaches the spot where the man had been sitting, then another sigh - but this time, a quiet one of relief "Oh good, used the whole thing. Would've been a real shitty idea if I wasn't here, but feels like I've gotta say that just in case he pops his clogs on the way out of here."

The speaking stops for a few minutes - the sounds of a man dragging another suited up man across metal, then the ground, then more metal - right up until there's a loud 'humph' and the noise of Maier being dropped down onto a medical bed. A few machines beep and whir to life, monitoring his vital signs and the like before the straps holding the patient to the bed are cinched tight and Steve returns to the cockpit.

"Lifeguard One, mission complete. One survivor found on board, five dead. Inform MT Protection so they can get this all cleaned up, our job here is done. On the way back up top, Jake, warm up the medbay - perhaps you'll get that case after all."
