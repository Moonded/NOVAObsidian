Ana had been sound asleep, having taken an extra dosage of muscle relaxers to allow her wounds to heal, the groggy combat medic hears the [[admirals]] voice and groans, covering her head with one of the three pillows strewn about her bunk. There was nothing that would get her to interrupt sleep. She had already in processed , had filled out all the requisite forms, now she would rest.

"I need you to investigate that [[Orphanage]], or what passes to be one, at least. Be ready though, things could be pretty grim in there, steady your heart and soul. The children being taken there are very real and something is happening to them, I will not allow the most vulnerable individuals of our society to be forgotten because their parents valiantly gave their lives to protect Stanton."

Hearing this the woman groans and throws the comforter off of her form. So much for sleep. Wearing sweatpants and a sport bra, Ana hurries off to the other side of her quarters to change the dressing on her shoulder. The bullet had missed her clavicle but millimetres, but it may as well shattered it with the amount of pain she was still in. Once done, the sound of running water could be heard as she activates her comms

"[[Alex]], get her ready, I'm leaving." she states as the medicinal gauze begins melding to the area around the closing bullet hole.  

"[[Ana]], nice to hear from you too, good morning in fact," [[Alex]] replies, his words oozing in teasing sarcasm.

"Yea yea, just get her ready please, there's kids that need help." The doc replies as her other hand leans in to check the waters temperature.

"Oh, uh, well that's different. You'll find clearance to launch in ten." Alex replies.  

Ana lets out a small yelp as the gauze works its medicinal magic on her shoulder. "Yup, sounds good."

"Ana? try not get shot again, please." Alex replies now in a more serious tone  

"No promises, gonna shower I'll call you when I'm in the air." She states before cutting the comms

Satisfied with the water, the doc gets undressed and begins to shower, fifteen minutes later as she power walks to the hangars she inhales and sends out a reply to the admiralty.

"Chappie inbound" was all it read
