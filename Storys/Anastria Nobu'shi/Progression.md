**NEW ENTRY: Journal of NOVA Commander - CORE ANASTRIA.NOBU'SHI**
**Title: Progression**

It's been a year and some change since the last log, so I might as well start back to them now, huh? God, I forgot what this felt like: Putting my thoughts into words like this. Therapist told me it would be better for my mental to journal again...

"Drake - Hotel One Tango, We have you on approach. You are cleared for landing to Hanger 06. Welcome back, Ana."

Clarcke, the one of the ATC guys at ARC-L1. I've been living out of this station for as long as I have been in [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]]. Most of the people here have started recognizing my Corsair's IFF by heart at this point.

I land the Ol' Girl and get her stored away when a voice comes over the comm.

"[[Commander Hitman]], please report to Admin in the Galleria."

Huh. This is new. Never been summoned by the PA system- wait, ARC-L1 has a PA system? In the Refinery maybe, but in the main concourse? 

Several Pilots and Owners watch me head to the elevators, my "mysterious and conspicuous" red and black [[Artimex]] Armor not fooling them in the slightest, they know exactly who I am.

Walking into the Admin, the desk clerk summons me over and without a word hands me a pink slip.

"What's this? Who is this from...?" My question trails off as I examine the paper.

Its a Register, Proof of Ownership. One Roberts Space Industries Galaxy-Class Ship. Signed and Authorized by... 

*Me?*
I quickly check my bank account balance. Normal, its all there. Not a single credit missing.

The Admin clerk speaks up, "Uhm, some guy came in, asked about you. Seemed he was in a hurry, he said... uh... I think, Thanks for the help... with the mining tips? Something about teaching him and his crew? I dunno."

"Ah. Indeed..." Looking on, I see a note attached to the bundle of papers:

**Thank you for your help. [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] has authorized me to allot to you a Freighter as congratulations on your new Squadron. Strategic Requisitions Squadron, has a good ring to it. You will do good work for [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] and for us in [[Frontiers]].**

Stapled to the note is a picture of the crew of the [[NSS Cousteau]] posing in front of the ship, signed by each of the members. My eyes start to water as I walk to the [[Easy Habs]].

*Look at that, Ana. You got good friends in [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]]. I'm happy for you.*

"Yeah, you're right, Anaias. Good friends."
