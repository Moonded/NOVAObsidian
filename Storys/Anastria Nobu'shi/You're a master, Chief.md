**NEW ENTRY: Journal of Freelance Pilot ANASTRIA.NOBU'SHI**
**Title: You're a master, Chief**

"This is [[Anastria]]. How can I be of service?"

The voice on the line was *not* what I was expecting to hear.

"Hey Ana... Got something you should see! I'm on Aberdeen ROC mining."

The one person who sticks around to do the most outlandish shit just because why not. I sigh and struggle a reply.

"Oh hey [[Kryllyk]]. Using your Hammerhead to go ROC mining again?"

That's typical of them, just like finding a way to get a Pisces stuck inside their [[Caterpiller]]. Because why not?

"Yup. You busy? Could get a crew together again and do some bounties in [[ArcCorp]] space..." They reply.

"Currently doing a package retrieval contract. Got to take it down to Orison, but afterwards... sure I'll put *your* crew together for *your* ship..."

*Don't look at me like that. Sarcasm is cheap these days, [[Anaias]]. Besides, You know just as well as I do they Regen every other week. I'm surprised they haven't gotten to their final life yet.*

"I know you enjoy blowing up criminals just as much as I do, besides the fact that you love being First Officer. I'll even throw in a Banu Artefact I bought in Pyro." 

That took me a second to consider. Banu merchants selling their goods in Pyro? I won't miss this opportunity to upgrade my [[Artimex]] suit back at ARC-L1.

"Sure, you drive me insane with your random bullshit that you pull, but I can't deny you are sometimes a master at being the Chief Officer. Let me get this contract done and I'll get your crew."

"Awesome. See you at the Terminals at Riker's?" They ask. Its our usual meetup spot.

"You know it. See you soon [[Kryllyk]]."
*I'm a fucking moron for doing this constantly for them, gotta get them to put their own crew together eventually and stop relying on my charisma to do it for them.*

After 30 long, gruelling minutes I'm setting my Corsair down on a pad in [[August Dunlow Memorial]] Spaceport in Orison, and finding the Delivery point the client directed me to. Easy 15k UEC.

That's when it hits me, the feeling of depression and emptiness.

*The fuck are you doing... measly pay-outs for mundane work? Worthless bitch. All that money in the bank and you aren't worth a penny of it. Risking your lives, for what? Some clients you never even know the names of? You have got to be joking, you absolute idiot. Fucking disgrace to the-*

**NO**

I mutter under my breath,

"Get out of my head, Father. If you wanted me to carry on the legacy you wouldn't have..." 

**sigh**

*Let's just get to Area 18, [[Anaias]]. I need to be in the pilot's seat before I lose my fucking mind.*
