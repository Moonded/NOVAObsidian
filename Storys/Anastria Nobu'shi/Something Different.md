**NEW ENTRY: Journal of Freelance Pilot ANASTRIA.NOBU'SHI**
**Title: Something Different**

"So you want to join [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]]... What are your preferences? Your choice of work?" asks Recruitment Officer D. Briggs.

"Well at the moment, I'm just mining Lyria and The Halo with my own Prospector. But, I've been a dropship Pilot and Ground Support element, as well as security for High-Risk cargo. In short, I could really do anything." I replied, straightening my back and looking directly into the Female Officer's eyes.

"Interesting. Since you have experience on file and have already made a name for yourself, I'm sure I can fit you pretty much anywhere. How do you feel about a Mining squad? Blue Moon Prospecting, led by [[Diamondhide]], is currently recruiting. I can arrange a meeting."

She smiles and bobs her head as she talks, her curly afro bouncing. *She has nice hair,* I think as she talks. *Wonder how long it takes to prepare at Lights On...*

I smile as she finished; "Yes, that sounds amazing. I'm excited to start as soon as possible."

"Good to hear. Diamondhide will reach out to you when he is ready." She stands, folding her hands behind her back. I Stand to meet her, nod, and walk to the threshold of her office, looking back at her.

"I'd also like to have my name down as an available Pilot for any Operations needing a Dropship Pilot. Is that okay, Ma'am?" I ask, cocking my head to the side slightly.

"Please, call me [[Briggs]]. And yes, I'll let the CO's and CIT's know of your availability."

"Thank you, [[Briggs]]. It's a pleasure to meet you."

Leaving the Recruitment Office, I find my Corsair sitting in Hanger 06. Right where I left the Old Girl. Her Size 5 gatlings always leave me awestruck as I walk past them to the elevator.

"No more freelancing, Anaias. I'm doing as you wanted. Signing on with a Corp might be a mistake, but you always wanted to see me thrive. I just hope you don't regret leaving me to make these moves alone..."
