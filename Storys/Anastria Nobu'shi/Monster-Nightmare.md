**NEW ENTRY: Journal of Freelance Pilot ANASTRIA.NOBU'SHI**
**Title: Monster/Nightmare**

It stares at me. Everywhere, I see it, glaring at me with malicious intent. Can't unsee it, can't get away from it. Always haunting me, always following me. 

***BANG***

My eyes open to see the dimly lit cabin in my Corsair's cockpit. Even through my [[ForceFlex]] DigiCamo Flightsuit, I'm sweating bullets. Can't seem to catch my breath for what feels like minutes as my heartrate slowly declines to normal levels. I finally release the death grip I have on my S-38.

*That stupid fucking nightmare... again. That makes, what, fourth time this week?* I sit on the bed, burying my face in my hands. *I need to get ahold of myself, keep a steady pace.*

My [[MobiGlass]] beeps on my wrist, signaling that my ship has reached its destination.

*Time to see what the client left on this damn moon.*

I sit down in the pilot's seat, the soft golden glow of [[Daymar]]'s surface below me. 10km to the crashsite. Typical grab and go contract, gotta find a package at this Constellation wreck, then deliver it at a Covalex droppoint in Orison.

I'm not really doing this for the money, honestly just waiting until I hear from [[Diamonhide]] about joining Blue Moon Prospecting. Briggs said it would be a few days, so I'm out here doing random jobs to keep me busy. I look at my UEC balance on my Mobi, out of habit:

34,548,921 UEC

*most of it from mining Quantanium, too...*

The ship's Nav blinks as the wreck comes into view over a massive rock: split into three parts, lots of miscellaneous 1/8 SCU boxes spewn across the ground near the cargo hold. Hope one of those is my objective, but I'm gonna grab it all and sell at [[Olisar]].

Setting the Corsair down in a clear patch of sand, I exit the ship through the Cargo hold. The smell of my freshly cleaned DustUp helmet hinted with Lavender.

"Oh, [[Daymar]]... How many lives did you claim with this one, huh? We *must* have a conversation about this... It's getting out of hand."
Sometime later I'm snapping 1/8 SCU boxes to the cargo grid, with the mission package set aside. Lots of Agricium, but also seeing some medical supplies. Think i'll store those in case I need those later. Time to get to [[Olisar]].

Minutes later as i'm leaving atmosphere, my Mobi suddenly emits a eerie tone, one i've never been able to get used to.

*Looks like i'm finally going to talk to [[Diamondhide]].* I answer the call.

"This is Anastria. How can I be of service?"
