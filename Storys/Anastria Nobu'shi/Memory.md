**NEW ENTRY: Journal of Freelance Pilot [[ANASTRIA.NOBU'SHI**]]
**Title: Memory**

"Dude. This thing has to be worth at least a hundred grand, and you got it for 30k?" I ask [[Kryllyk]] in their Hammerhead's Captain's room.

"From what I could tell, The Banu Merchantmen were just passing through pyro to get closer to Terra. Needed credits for supplies, didn't care too much about real value." [[Kryllyk]] responds, in an abnormally refined manner for their usual demeanour.

"With this, I can activate the Armor hardening protocols in my [[Artimex]]. Should make me nigh-on invulnerable to small arms and blades. I know the [[Vanduul]] would despise Humanity if the [[UEE]] had this in supply."

"Possible. I did see what could have been a shield module for personal Armor, but it was priced at well over 3 million credits, and I ain't made of cash."

"Damn. I wish you had called, I would've gave you the dosh for tech like that. In my line of work? A personal shield mod would make a hell of a difference with..."

*The memory flashes before me before I can suppress it: The subject of the nightmare that torments me. The blinding light, the deafening roar. The blood, everywhere, dripping from my fingers and arms as I look up to realize my darkest fear*

I shake it out of my head.

They look at me slightly worried, "The memory?"

I swallow and regain my composure, and I feel a small tear fall down my cheek. "Yeah. I'm okay though."
 
They stand up and pat me on the shoulder. 

"You're still here. You made it out. That makes you stronger than you realize, Anastria."

"I know. Let's get back to [[Area 18]]."

They nod and send the order to the pilot, and the ship's engines roar as we align for the quantum tunnel.

Hours later Kryllyk and I are at the G-Loc bar in Area 18 with drinks all around us. Chaotic isn't enough of a description for them, but they do have their moments of serene wisdom and calm.

"Still waiting to hear back from this Diamonhide fella?" They ask.
"Mhmm. I asked around, seems they are pretty busy. Turns out he is an Admiral with his own Squadron, so makes sense he wouldn't be able to get to lil ole me on short notice."

 "But you've got this Operation to accompany some Nova explorers to Microtech with a small entourage of Starfarers? How does that work?"
 
 "Seems to me we are viewed as a kinda 'Independent Contractor' sorta thing. I can volunteer for any Ops as long as they wouldn't interfere with any Squadron responsibilities, of which I don't have any."
 
 *The drink's gone, dummy. Order another Screwdriver, they are amazing here.*
 
 *Heh. Thanks for the tip, Anaias.*
 
 They tap their drink on the counter. "Well I should be going. Was good to work with you again, Ana. See you next time."
 
 "Have a good night, Kryllyk. See you."
 
 Sleep was a cruel mistress tonight.
 
 *You wont see him again. You watched him get vaporized and you did nothing. How can you call yourself a Merc if you can't keep your crew safe? And you think this [[Nova Intergalactic|NOVA]] shit is gonna be any different?*
 
 ***YOU. WILL. KILL. THEM. ALL.***
 
 *No, I won't! It wasn't my fault! I couldn't do anything! His death was avenged! I made that pilot pay for what they did!*
 
 ***YOU. LET. ME. DIE***
 
 I let out a blood curdling scream, clutching my head as the vision of the ship's guns ripping my brother into pieces replays over and over in my mind.
 
 "I'm so sorry... I didn't... I couldn't..."
 
 Tears stream down my face, the quiet sobs vibrating my body as the soft hum of the ship reminds me of reality.
 
 "I should've died instead of you, Anaias."
